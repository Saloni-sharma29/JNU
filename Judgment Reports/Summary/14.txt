for  the assessment year 1950-51 the respondent submitted  a
return  of  its net turnover to the  deputy  commercial  tax
officer  who was the assessing authority.  as he  determined
the net turnover at a higher amount the respondent  appealed
to  the commercial tax officer, who allowed the appeal  with
respect  to one item.  on 28th november 1952, the  assessing
authority issued a revised assessment order as per the order
of  the commercial tax officer.  on 27th december 1952,  the
respondent  presented a revision petition before the  deputy
commissioner of commercial taxes raising the only objection,
as a new -contention, that it should not have been  assessed
to  tax on amounts collected by it by way of tax.   on  21st
august 1954, the deputy commissioner dismissed the  petition
on the ground that the respondent was not entitled to  raisestate of madras vs madurai mills co., ltd on 4 october, 1966
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28118/ 1a  new contention for the first time.  on 4th  august  1958.
the  board  of  revenue issued a notice  to  the  respondent
stating  that  it  proposed  to  revise  the  assessment  by
including  in the net turnover a sum representing the  value
of cotton purchased by the respondent from outside the state
and  which was excluded by the assessing  authority.   after
considering the respondent's objections the board fixed  the
net   taxable  turnover  by  including  that  amount.    the
respondent's appeal to the high court was allowed.
in appeal by the state,
held  :  the  order of the board  of  revenue  was  invalid,
because, under s. 12(4) (b) of the madras general  sales-tax
act, 1939, the board of revenue could invoke its  revisional
jurisdiction.only  within four years from the date on  which
the order of the assessing authority was communicated to the
assessee. [734 g; 736 b-c]
(i)the  subject-matter of the revision proceedings  before
the  board of revenue was only the revised assessment  order
of the assessing authority dated 28th november 1952, and not
the deputy commissioner's order dated 21st august 1954. [736
c]
the  objection  taken by the board was with  regard  to  the
question of exemption allowed by the assessing authority  on
the  value  of  cotton  purchased  from  outside,  and  that
question  was  not'  raised in revision  before  the  deputy
commissioner of commercial taxes. [736 c-d]
(ii)it  cannot  be  said  that  the  order  of  the  deputy
commissioner  of commercial taxes, in revision, is the  only
operative decision in law on the basis that the order of the
inferior  tribunal  (the order of  the  assessing  authority
dated  28th  november 1952) merged in that of  the  superior
tribunal  (order  of the deputy commissioner  of  commercial
taxes, dated 21st august 1954). [736 f]
the  application  of the doctrine of merger depends  on  the
nature of the appellate or revisional order in each case and
the scope of the statu-
                            733
tory  provisions  conferring  the  appellate  or  revisional
jurisdiction.   in the circumstances of the present case  it
could  not be said that there was a merger of the  order  of
assessment  dated  november  28,  1952  with  the  order  in
revision  dated 21st august 1954, because, the  question  of
exclusion  of the value of yarn purchased from  outside  the
state  was  not the subject-matter of  revision  before  the
deputy commissioner of commercial taxes. [737 a-b, f-h]
