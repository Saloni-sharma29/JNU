respondents no. 2 to 4, regular employees of the  appel-
lant delhi transport corporation, were served with  termina-
tion notices under regulation 9(b) of the delhi road  trans-
port authority (conditions of appointment & service) regula-
tions, 1952 by the appellant corporation on the ground  that
they  became inefficient in their work and started  inciting
other members not to perform their duties.
    the three respondents and their union, respondent no.  1
filed writ petition in high court, challenging the constitu-
tional  validity of regulation 9(b), which gave the  manage-
ment  right  to  terminate the services of  an  employee  by
giving one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof. the  divi-
sion  bench  of the high court struck down  the  regulation,
holding  that  the regulation gave absolute,  unbridled  and
arbitrary powers to the management to terminate the services
of  any permanent or temporary employee, and such power  was
violative  of  article 14 of the  constitution.  hence,  the
corporation  filed the appeal before this court, by  special
leave.
    the  validity of similar provisions in para 522  of  the
shastri  award, rule 1(i) of the district board rules  1926,
part v, regulation 13 of indian airlines employees'  service
regulations,  regulation 48 of air india employees'  service
regulations and also the clause in the contract of  appoint-
ment  in respect of employees of zilla parishad and the  new
india  assurance company, also came up for consideration  in
the  connected  appeals and applications filed  before  this
court.
    it was contended on behalf of the delhi transport corpo-
ration  that  there was sufficient guideline  in  regulationdelhi transport corporation vs d.t.c. mazdoor congress on 4 september, 1990
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/268805/ 29(b) and the power of termination, properly read, would  not
be arbitrary or violative of article 14 of the constitution,
that the court would be entitled to obtain guidance from the
preamble,  the  policy and the purpose of the  act  and  the
power  conferred  under  it and to see that  the  power  was
exercised  only  for  that purpose, that even  a  term  like
'public interest' could be sufficient guidance in the matter
of retirement of a government employee, and such a provision
could be read into a statute even when it was not  otherwise
expressly  there,  that it was well-settled that  the  court
would  sustain the presumption of constitutionality by  con-
sidering  matters  of common knowledge and to  assume  every
state of facts which could be conceived and could even  read
down  the  section,  if it became necessary  to  uphold  the
validity of the provision, that the underlying
144
rationale of this rule of interpretation, or the doctrine of
reading  down  of a statute being that when  a  legislature,
whose  powers were not unlimited, enacted a statute, it  was
aware  of  its limitations, and in the  absence  of  express
intention  or  clear language to the contrary,  it  must  be
presumed  to  have implied into the  statute  the  requisite
limitations and conditions to immunise it from the virus  of
unconstitutionality,  that since every legislature  intended
to  act  within  its powers, in a  limited  government,  the
legislature  would  attempt to function within  its  limited
powers  and  it would not be expected to  have  intended  to
transgress its limits, that the guidelines for the  exercise
of  the  power of termination simpliciter  under  regulation
9(b) could be found in the statutory provisions of the  1950
act under which the regulations had been framed, the  pream-
ble; sections 19, 20 and 53, the context of regulation  9(b)
read  with regulations 9(a) and 15, that even for the  exer-
cise of this power, reasons could be recorded although  they
need  not be communicated which would ensure a check on  the
arbitrary exercise of power and effective judicial review in
a given case, ensuring efficient running of services and  in
public interest and the regulations in question were  paral-
lel  to, but not identical with, the exceptions  carved  out
under  proviso  to article 311(2), that even  the  power  of
termination simipliciter under regulation 9(b) could only be
exercised  in circumstances other than those  in  regulation
9(a),  i.e. not where the foundation of the order was  'mis-
conduct',  the  exercise  of such power could  only  be  for
purposes  germane  and  relevant to the  statute,  that  the
principles  of natural justice or holding of an  enquiry  is
neither  a  universal principle of  justice  nor  inflexible
dogma and the principles of natural justice were not incapa-
ble  of  exclusion in a given situation,  if  importing  the
right to be heard has the effect of paralysing the  adminis-
trative  process or the need for promptitude or the  urgency
of  the-  situation  so demands, natural  justice  could  be
avoided;  that the words "where it is not  reasonably  prac-delhi transport corporation vs d.t.c. mazdoor congress on 4 september, 1990
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/268805/ 3ticable to hold an enquiry" may be imported into the regula-
tion, that where termination took place by the exclusion  of
audi alteram partem rule in circumstances which were circum-
scribed  and  coupled  with the safeguard  of  recording  of
reasons  which were germane and relevant, then the  termina-
tion  would not render the regulation unreasonable or  arbi-
trary,  and  if the regulation was read in  this  manner  it
could not be said that the power was uncanalised or  unguid-
ed,  that  under ordinary law of "master  and  servant"  the
corporation  was  empowered by the contract  of  service  to
terminate  the services of its employees in  terms  thereof;
the  declaration in brojo nath's case that such  a  contract
was  void  under section 23 of the indian  contract  act  or
opposed  to public policy offending the  fundamental  rights
and  the  directive principles was not sound in  law;  as  a
master, the corporation had unbridled right
145
to  terminate  the contract in the  interests  of  efficient
functioning  of  the corporation or to  maintain  discipline
among its employees, and if the termination, was found to be
wrongful, the only remedy available to the employees was  to
claim damages for wrongful termination but not a declaration
as was granted in brojo nath's case.
    on  behalf of the workmen/intervenors, it was  submitted
that  provision of any rule that service would be liable  to
termination  on  notice for the  period  prescribed  therein
contravened article 14 of the constitution, as arbitrary and
uncontrolled  power was left in the authority to  select  at
its will any person against whom action would be taken; that
articles 14, 19 and 21 were inter-related and article 21 did
not exclude article 19 and even if there was a law providing
a  procedure for depriving a person of personal liberty  and
there was, consequently no infringement of fundamental right
conferred  by article 21, such law in so far as it  abridged
or  took away any fundamental right under article  19  would
have  to meet the challenge of that article, that  violation
of  principle of natural justice by state action was  viola-
tion  of article 14 which could be excluded only  in  excep-
tional circumstances, and, therefore, a clause which  autho-
rised the employer to terminate the services of an employee,
whose contract of service was for indefinite period or  till
the age of retirement, by serving notice, and which did  not
contain  any  guidance  for the exercise of  the  power  and
without recording reasons for such termination, violated the
fundamental  rights guaranteed under articles  14,  19(1)(g)
and 21 and principles of natural justice and was void  under
section 2(g) of the indian contract act, 1872, and  unforce-
able under section 2(hi; that since audi alteram partem  was
a  requirement  of article 14. and conferment  of  arbitrary
power  itself was contrary to article 14, the rule in  ques-
tion could not be sustained as valid; that the constitution-
al guarantees under articles 14 and 21 were for all  persons
and there could be no basis for making a distinction betweendelhi transport corporation vs d.t.c. mazdoor congress on 4 september, 1990
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/268805/ 4'workmen'  to  whom the industrial disputes  act  and  other
industrial  laws  applied and those who were  outside  their
purview, and the law applicable to the former could only add
to and not detract from the rights guaranteed by part 111 of
the  constitution; that the power to terminate the  services
of  a person employed to serve indefinitely or till the  age
of  retirement  could be exercised only in cases  of  proved
misconduct or exceptional circumstances having regard to the
constitutional   guarantee  available  under   article   14 ,
19(1)(g)  and  21 and unless the  exceptional  circumstances
were  spelt out, the power to terminate the  services  would
cover  both permissible and impermissible grounds  rendering
it wholly invalid, particularly because, the requirement  of
audi alteram partem which was a part of the guarantee of
146
article 14 was sought to be excluded, and there could be  no
guidance available in the body of the law itself, since  the
purpose  for  which an undertaking was established  and  the
provisions dealing with the same in the law could provide no
guidance  regarding  exceptional circumstances  under  which
alone  the power could be exercised, that the  question  in-
volved,  in the instant cases was not the exercise of  power
which an employer possessed to terminate the services of his
employee,  but the extent of that power; that provisions  of
regulation  9(b)  of  the  delhi  road  transport  authority
(conditions  of appointment and service) regulations,  1952,
could not be rendered constitutional by reading the require-
ment of recording reasons and confining it to cases where it
was not reasonably practicable to hold an enquiry and  read-
ing it down further as being applicable to only  exceptional
cases would not be permissible construction and proper; that
the  regulation conferred arbitrary power of leaving  it  to
the  dtc  management to pick and choose, either to  hold  an
enquiry  or terminate the services for the  same  misconduct
and  there was nothing in the provisions of the act  or  the
regulations  from which the management could find any  guid-
ance  and, therefore, in order to conform to  the  constitu-
tional guarantees contained in articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 21,
the  regulation  would have to make  a  distinction  between
cases  where services were sought to be terminated for  mis-
conduct and cases of termination on grounds other than  what
would  constitute misconduct; that regulation 9(b)  deliber-
ately conferred wide power of termination of service without
giving reasonable opportunity to an employee even if he  was
regular or permanent employee, in addition to regulation  15
which provided for dismissal or removal after a disciplinary
enquiry,  thus, the intention of the  regulation-making  au-
thority  was  clear and unambiguous; the provision  was  not
capable of two interpretations, and consequently, the  ques-
tion of reading down did not arise, and reading down in  the
instant cases involved not interpretation of any single word
in  regulation 9(b) but adding a whole clause to  it,  which
amounted  to  rewriting  the provisions,  which  courts  haddelhi transport corporation vs d.t.c. mazdoor congress on 4 september, 1990
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/268805/ 5refused to make up for the omission of the legislature,  and
would  inevitably drain out article 14 of its vitality,  and
the right to equality which was regarded as a basic  feature
of the constitution, and subject permanent employees of  the
dtc to a tremendous sense of insecurity which is against the
philosophy  and scheme of the constitution, that unless  the
provision of the constitution itself excluded the principles
of  natural justice, they continued to be applicable  as  an
integral  part  of the right to equality guaranteed  by  the
constitution,  that  as the employees of the  dtc  were  not
government employees, article 311(2) was not applicable, and
article  14 fully applied to them, including the  principles
of natural justice.
147
    on behalf of the indian airlines corporation and the air
india, which filed intervention applications, it was submit-
ted  that there had been distinction between  the  discharge
simpliciter and dismissal from service by way of punishment,
that  the effect of the judgments of this court in the  cen-
tral inland water's case and west bengal's case was to  take
away the right of the employer to terminate the services  of
an employee by way of discharge simpliciter, that this court
had  recognised  the existence of the inherent right  of  an
employer  to terminate the services of an employee in  terms
of  the  contract of employment and also under  the  various
labour  enactments,  that  a plain reading  of  the  amended
regulation 13 of the indian airlines employees'  regulations
and  a cumulative reading of the amended regulations 48  and
44  of the air india employees service  regulations  clearly
established that the vice, if any, of arbitrariness had been
completely removed and that the power to terminate had  been
vested  with the board of directors, and not with any  indi-
vidual,  and  sufficient guidelines made  available  to  the
board to exercise the restricted and limited power available
to the employer under these regulations.
    on  behalf  of another intervenor, new  india  assurance
co.,  it was submitted that the central inland water's  case
was erroneous, insofar as it made complete negation of power
of  the employer to terminate and rendered  the  termination
illegal  even where the employer had made all the  necessary
investigation  and  had given hearing to the  employee  con-
cerned  before  making the order, and took in  even  private
employment; therefore, the judgment of this court should  be
read down and made applicable prospectively.
    in  civil  appeal no. 4073 of 1986 it was  contended  on
behalf  of the bank employee whose services were  terminated
under  para 522 of the shastri award, that mere  failure  of
the  employee to mention the loan taken by him from  another
branch  of  the  bank, which was  repaid  subsequently,  had
deprived him of his livelihood, and his services were termi-
nated without charge of 'misconduct' and without an enquiry,
and paragraph 522 of the shastri award gave no indication as
to  on  what conditions this  arbitrary  uncontrolled  powerdelhi transport corporation vs d.t.c. mazdoor congress on 4 september, 1990
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/268805/ 6could be used to get rid of one or more permanent  employees
for  "efficient management of banks" on subjective  opinions
or suspicion not tested in enquiry into facts, and that this
provision  provided for "insecurity of tenure" for lakhs  of
permanent  employees; articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 21  and  the
integrated  protection of these fundamental rights  excluded
the  "doctrine  of  pleasure" and insisted  on  security  of
tenure "during good behaviour", and the right to  livelihood
could not be rendered precari-
148
ous or reduced to a "glorious 'uncertainty", that no princi-
ple of interpretation permitted reading down a provision  so
as to make it into a different provision altogether  differ-
ent  from what was intended by the legislature or its  dele-
gate,  and  there could not be any reading  down  which  was
contrary  to the principles of interpretation; that  if  two
provisions  existed,  firstly to remove from  service  after
holding an enquiry on a charge of 'misconduct' and secondly,
without  serving a charge-sheet or holding an  enquiry,  all
provisions for holding enquiry would be rendered otiose  and
would be reduced to a mere redundancy, that the court had  a
duty  to correct wrongs even if orders had been  made  which
were  later found to be violative of any  fundamental  right
and  to recall its orders to avoid injustice; that  substan-
tive  provision of para 522 could not be controlled or  cur-
tailed  effectively  so as to confine its  operation  within
narrow  constitutional limits; that it was not the  duty  of
the  court  to condone the constitutional  delinquencies  of
those  limited by the constitution if they arrogated  uncon-
trolled  unconstitutional powers, which were neither  neces-
sary nor germane for supposed efficiency of services in  the
banks  as a business enterprise, and that in a  system  gov-
erned by rule of law, discretion when conferred upon  execu-
tive  authorities  must be confined within  clearly  defined
limits.
    in civil appeal no. i 115 of 1976, the appellant-employ-
ee  of  the zila parishad contended that his  services  were
terminated  on account of the vindictiveness of some of  the
employees  of the respondent, and without enquiry.  the  em-
ployer  submitted that the termination order was  passed  on
the  basis of the condition in the mutually agreed terms  of
contract of appointment, and resolution passed by the board,
and  that  rule 1(i) of district board rules, 1926,  part  v
gave  right to both the parties to terminate the  employment
on one month's notice.
    on  the  questions (i) whether regulation  9(b)  of  the
delhi  road transport authority (conditions  of  appointment
and  service)  regulations, 1952,  was  arbitrary,  illegal,
discriminatory  and violative of audi alteram partem and  so
constitutionally  invalid  and void; and  (ii)  whether  the
regulation  could  be interpreted and read down  in  such  a
manner  as to hold that it was not discriminatory, or  arbi-
trary and did not confer unbriddled and uncanalised power ondelhi transport corporation vs d.t.c. mazdoor congress on 4 september, 1990

    dismissing civil appeal no. 2876 of 1986 (appeal by  the
delhi transport corporation), allowing civil appeal no. 1115
of  1976, and directing other matters to be placed before  a
division bench, in ac-
149
cordance with the majority decision (per ray, sharma, sawant
and k. ramaswamy, jj.) this court,
held: per ray, j.:
    1. i regulation 9(b) of the delhi road transport author-
ity  (conditions  of appointment and  service)  regulations,
1952 which confers powers on the authority to terminate  the
services of a permanent and confirmed employee by issuing  a
notice terminating the services or by making payment in lieu
of  notice  without assigning any reasons in the  order  and
without  giving any opportunity of hearing to  the  employee
before  passing the orders is wholly arbitrary,  uncanalised
and unrestricted violating principles of natural justice  as
well  as article 14 of the constitution. there is no  guide-
line  in  the  regulations or in the  delhi  road  transport
authority act, 1950 as to when or in which cases and circum-
stances this power of termination by giving notice or pay in
lieu thereof can be exercised. [264g, 285c]
    1.2  government companies or public  corporations  which
carry  on trade and business activity of state  being  state
instrumentalities,  are state within the meaning of  article
12  of the constitution and as such they are subject to  the
observance  of  fundamental rights embodied in part  111  as
well as to conform to the directive principles in part iv of
the constitution. in other words, the service regulations or
rules  framed by them are to be tested by the touchstone  of
article  14 of the constitution. furthermore, the  procedure
prescribed by their rules or regulations must be reasonable,
fair and just and not arbitrary, fanciful and unjust. [264h,
265a-b]
    1.3  the 'audi alteram partem' rule which,  in  essence,
enforces the equality clause in article 14 of the  constitu-
tion is applicable not only to quasi-judicial orders but  to
administrative orders affecting prejudicially the  party-in-
question  unless  the application of the rule has  been  ex-
pressly  excluded by the act or regulation or rule which  is
not  the case here. rules of natural justice do no  supplant
but supplement the rules and regulations. moreover, the rule
of  law, which permeates the constitution of india,  demands
that   it  has  to  be  observed  both   substantially   and
procedurally.  rule  of  law posits that  the  power  to  be
exercised in a manner which is just, fair and reasonable and
not  in  an  unreasonable, capricious  or  arbitrary  manner
leaving room for discrimination. [265d-e]
regulation  9(b) does not expressly exclude the  application
of thedelhi transport corporation vs d.t.c. mazdoor congress on 4 september, 1990
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/268805/ 8150
'audi alteram parterm' rule and as such the order of  termi-
nation  of service of a permanent employee cannot be  passed
by  simply issuing a month's notice or pay in  lieu  thereof
without recording any reason in the order and without giving
any hearing to the employee to controvert the allegation  on
the basis of which the purported order is made. [265f]
    1.4  considering from all these aspects regulation  9(b)
is illegal and void, as it is arbitrary, discriminatory  and
without any guidelines for exercise of the power. it confers
unbridled, uncanalised and arbitrary power on the  authority
to  terminate the services of a permanent  employee  without
recording any reasons and without conforming to the  princi-
ples of natural justice. it is also void under section 23 of
the contract act, as being opposed to public policy and also
ultra vires of article 14 of the constitution. [265e,  265b-
