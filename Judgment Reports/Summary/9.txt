the  appellant company carried on  land-developing  business
       and  sold land after development on a profit.  the whole  of
       the development was not carried out before the land was sold
       nor the whole of the sale price received in cash at the time
       of  the  sale.   in  the accounting  year  in  question  the
       appellant  sold a number of plots and received a portion  of
       the  sale  price but as it maintained its  accounts  in  the
       mercantile  method  it entered the whole  price  receivable,
       viz.,  rs.  43,692-11-9,  in credit  side  though  only  rs.
       29,392-11-9  was actually received and debited a sum of  rs.
       24,809, being the estimated expenditure for the developments
       it  had, by terms incorporated in the deeds of sale,  under-
       taken  to carry out within six months thereof,  although  no
       part  of  it  was  actually spent  during  that  year.   the
       appellant claimed a deduction of the said sum of rs.  24,809messrs. calcutta company ltd vs the commissioner of ... on 12 may, 1959
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/791231/ 1       in  computation  of the profits and gains  of  its  business
       during  the assessment year.  the income-tax officer,  while
       accepting the method of accounting adopted by the appellant,
       disallowed  the  'claim on the ground that no  expenses  had
       actually been incurred and the estimate was only a  probable
       one.   the appellate assistant commissioner as well  as  the
       income-tax appellate tribunal confirmed the disallowance  on
       appeals and the high court, on a reference under s. 66(1) of
       the income-tax act held against the appellant.  the question
       was  whether the deduction claimed was a  legally  allowable
       expense of the year in question.
       held, that the liability which was undertaken by the  appel-
       lant  under the deeds of sale was an accrued  liability  and
       not  a contingent one.  although the time of six months  was
       not  of the essence of the contract, the undertaking it  had
       given  was  unconditional  and absolute  in  terms  and  the
       liability  must be held to have accrued on the execution  of
       the deeds of sale though it was to be discharged at a future
       date.

       the  difficulty in estimating such a liability for  purposes
       of debit under the mercantile system of accounting could  be
       no ground for treating an accrued liability as a conditional
       one, since it was always open to the income-tax  authorities
       to arrive a proper estimate thereof having regard to all the
       circumstances of the case.

       regard  being  had, therefore, to  the  accepted  commercial
       practice  and trading principles, the  estimated  deduction,
       even if it did not come under any of the specific provisions
       of s. 10(2) of the act, was certainly an allowable deduction
       under  s.  10(1)  of the act, there  being  no  prohibition,
       either  express  or  implied, against it  in  the  act  and,
       consequently,   the  question  must  be  answered   in   the
       affirmative.
