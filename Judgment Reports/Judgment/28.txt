act:
income-tax  act ,  1961:  ss. 74  and  80--claim  of  set
off--when  admissible-assessee whether entitled  to  benefit
conferred under s. 24 of 1922 act.
headnote:
    sub-section  (3) of s. 24 of the income-tax  act,  1922,
required that when it was established that a loss of profits
or gains had taken place. which the assessee was entitled to
have  set off, the income-tax officer should notify  to  the
assessee  by an order in writing the amount of loss as  com-
puted  by  him. this benefit was continued in s. 74  of  the
income-tax act, 1961 which provides for carrying forward  to
the  following  years the net loss computed under  the  head
'capital  gains' in respect of an assessment  year.  section
80,  however, interdicts that no loss which has not been  so
determined shall be carried forward and set off.
    the assessee, a private limited company disclosed in its
return for the assessment year 1965-66 capital gains of rs.3
lacs  and odd but claimed set off of capital loss of a  like
amount  sustained  during the assessment year  1957-58  over
sale of shares. this claim was disallowed by the  income-tax
officer  on  the footing that when in  the  assessment  yearcommissioner of income-tax, ... vs behari lal ram charan ltd on 22 april, 1987
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/976286/ 11957-58 the loss was claimed it was excluded in the computa-
tion of income as capital loss. a challenge to that order by
the assessee was rejected by the appellate assistant commis-
sioner  who  took  the view that the  loss  was  essentially
notional  in  nature, and that the claim for set off  to  be
admissible,  had  to be notified by the  income-tax  officer
under  s. 24(3) of the 1922 act to the assessee by an  order
in  writing.  that having not been done the  claim  was  not
admissible.
    allowing  the  assessee's claim, the  tribunal  however,
came to the conclusion that the assessee was entitled to the
benefit of set off of loss provided it satisfied that  capi-
tal  loss  was  computed under the old act, and  as  in  the
instant case the income-tax officer had neither computed the
loss nor passed an adverse order. the income-tax officer was
not entitled to take advantage of his own failure and reject
the assessee's
1160
claim  on  the ground that loss had not been  determined  as
required under s. 24(3) of the income-tax act, 1922.
    the high court agreed with the conclusion of the  tribu-
nal and found against the revenue.
dismissing the appeal, the court,
    held: reading the provisions of s. 74(1)(b) and s. 80 of
the income-tax act, 1961 together makes it evident that  the
benefit  conferred  under  s. 24 of the 1922  act  has  been
continued  to  be given effect to under the  1961  act.  and
notwithstanding  the words of s. 80 of the latter  act,  the
claim  of set off was admissible. the conclusion reached  by
the high court was. therefore. correct. [1166cd]
    the income-tax officer in the instant case, did  compute
the  amount by specifying it in his assessment  order.  when
the  assessee had made the claim and the income-tax  officer
took  rote  of it, his failure to comply strictly  with  the
requirement of sub-s. (3) of s. 24 of the 1922 act could not
be  permitted to be taken advantage of by the  revenue.  nor
could it be used to the prejudice of the assessee. [1164d]

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/976286/ 2tax act. 1961 (hereinaf- ter referred to as 'the act') is assailed by the revenue. the relevant
assessment year is 1965-66 corresponding to the previous year ending on 31.12. 1964. in its return
the assessee, a pri-
vate limited company. disclosed capital gains of rs.3.10,200 but claimed set off of capital loss of
rs.3.17,500 sustained by it during the assessment year 1957-58 over sale of shares to three associate
concerns. it was maintained by the asses- see that the loss was sustained in the previous year rele-
vant to the assessment year 1957-58 and the same should be set off against the capital gains in the
assessment year in question. the income-tax officer disallowed the claim for set off on the footing
that when in the assessment year 1957-58 the loss was claimed it was excluded in the computa- tion
of income as capital loss and the appellate assistant commissioner while disposing of the assessee's
appeal had stated that it was a notional capital loss. as no further appeal was carried by the
assessee, with the first appellate order the matter had become final.
the assessee challenged the rejection of its claim of set off before the appellate assistant
commissioner and he dismissed the appeal by holding that there was no genuine loss; it was
essentially notional in nature and that the claim for set off to be admissible had to be notified by the
income-tax officer under section 24(3) of the 1922 act to the assessee by an order in writing. that
having not been done, the claim was not admissible. thereupon the assessee went before the
appellate tribunal and reiterated its claim. the tribunal came to the .conclusion that the assessee
was entitled to the benefit of set off of loss provided it satisfied that its capital loss was computed
under the old act. in its view as the assessee had filed its return show- ing the loss and the
income-tax officer neither computed the loss nor passed an adverse order, the income-tax officer
was not entitled to take advantage of his own failure and reject the assessee's claim of carry forward
and set off of loss on the ground that loss had not been determined as required under section 24(3)
of the income-tax act, 1922. the tribu- nal further found that the income-tax officer had clearly
disallowed the assessee's claim of revenue loss by holding that it was a capital loss. it found that the
appellate assistant commissioner had no justification to hold that the claim of loss was not genuine
while disposing of the appeal for the assessment year 1957-58 and ultimately allowed the assessee's
claim. at the instance of the revenue four ques- tions were referred for opinion of the high court.
1. whether on the facts and in the circum- stances of the case, the income-tax officer's order for the
assessment year 1957-58 had not merged in the appellate assistant commission- er's order in which
the appellate assistant commissioner had given a clear finding that the loss was notional?
2. if the answer to the above question is in the negative, whether any loss could be said to have been
determined for the assessment year 1957-58, which could be carried forward to subsequent years?
3. whether in view of the provisions of sec- tion 80 of the income-tax act, 1961, the loss claimed for
the assessment year 1957-58 could be set off against the income determined for the assessment year
1965-66?
4. whether the tribunal was justified in law in holding that the provisions in section 24(3)
regarding intimation of losses deter- mined by the income-tax officer do not. apply to the losscommissioner of income-tax, ... vs behari lal ram charan ltd on 22 april, 1987
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/976286/ 3falling under the head 'capital'? the high court found that the income-tax officer in the assessment
order for 1957-58 had mentioned:
              "net    loss   as   per   profit   and    loss
              account--adjust rs.3, 17,205.
                         (i)  loss  on  sale  of  investment
              being
                              capital : rs.3, 17,500-00
                         (ii) income-tax   :rs.    204-00
                              total        : rs.3, 17,704-00
                              income      :rs.    499-00"
it is true that in appeal the appellate assistant com- missioner had held:-
"a perusal of the assessment records show that the appellant held 2,500 ordinary
shares in m/s. b.r. ltd. these shares were held on investment account and were not
stock-in-trade of the company. m/s. b.r. ltd. is an associat- ed concern and the
shares were sold to allied concerns and a loss of rs.3, 17,500 was worked out. firstly,
the shares were investment shares. secondly, the price for which the shares were
transferred to another associated concern was a notional price. the management just
transferred the shares held by one compa- ny to another company under their control
and management. of course, the transfer was not a trading activity. in these
circumstances, i hold that the income- tax officer has rightly disallowed the loss
claimed, the same being notional capital loss."
the high court found that both the income-tax officer as also the appellate assistant
commissioner had found that the loss was a capital loss. the high court fur:her found:-
"in our opinion this section (section 80 of the 1961 act) cannot apply to a case where
in law a return could not have been filed under section 139. that is to say in relation
to assessment years prior to the coming into force of the income-tax act, 1961 a
return could not possibly have been filed under section 139 because in these years
this sec- tion was not on the statute book. but if section 80 is construed to mean that
a return filed under the income-tax act 1922 is also within its purview then in our
opinion the requirement of this section was equally ful- filled because the assessee
has for the as- sessment year 1957-58 filed a return of loss which loss had been
determined by the income- tax officer in the assessment order."
the high court took the view that in the order for assessment year 1957-58. the appellate assistant
commission- er has referred to the claims of loss as notional when he really meant that it was an
estimate. it agreed with the conclusion of the tribunal and found against the revenue. section 24 of
the 1922 act which applied to the assess- ment year 1957-58 as far as relevant provided:
"(1) where any assessee sustains a loss of profits or gains in any year under any of the
heads mentioned in section 6, he shall be entitled to have the amount of the loss set
off against his income, profits or gains under any other head in that year ....... " (2a)commissioner of income-tax, ... vs behari lal ram charan ltd on 22 april, 1987
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/976286/ 4notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where the loss sustained is a
loss falling under the head 'capital gains'. such loss shall not be set off except against
any profits and gains falling under that head."
(2b) where an assessee sustains a loss such as is referred to in sub-section (2a) and
the loss cannot be wholly set off in accordance with the provisions of that sub-section,
the portion not so set off shall be carried for- ward to the following year and set off
against capital gains for that year, and if it cannot be so set off, the amount thereof
not so set off shall be carried forward to the following year and so on. so. however,
that no loss shall be carried forward for more than eight years .....................................
(3) "when, in the course of the assessment of the total income of any assessee. it is
estab- lished that a loss of profits or gains has taken place which he is entitled to have
set off under the provisions of this section, the income-tax officer shall notify to the
asses- see by order in writing the amount of the loss as computed by him for the
purposes of this section."
the high court has found that the income-tax officer did compute the amount by specifying it in
his assessment order. when the assessee had made the claim and he took note of it. his failure to
comply strictly with the requirement of sub- section (3) of section 24 should not be permitted to be
taken advantage of by the revenue, nor should it be used to the prejudice of the assessee.
since set off has been claimed in the assessment year 1965-66 to which the act of 1961 applied, it is
necessary to turn attention to the relevant provisions thereof and they are in sections 74 and 80. for
convenience they are extract- ed:
"section 74: (1)(a) where in respect of any assessment year. the net result of the
compu- tation under the head "capital gains" is a loss such loss shall. subject to the
other provisions of this chapter. be dealt with as follows:
"(i) such portion of the net loss (relating to short-term capital/assets as cannot be or
is not wholly set off against income under any head in accordance with the provisions
of section 71 shall be carried forward to the following assessment year and set off
against the capital gains, if any, relating to short- term capital assets assessable for
that as- sessment year. and, if it cannot be so set off, the amount thereof not so set off
shall be carried forward to the following assessment year and so on."
"(ii) such portion of the net loss as relates to capital assets other than short-term
capi- tal assets shall be carried forward to the following assessment year and set off
against the capital gains. if any. relating to capital assets other than short-term
capital assets assessable for that assessment year and. if it cannot be so set off. the
amount thereof not so set off shall be carried forward to the following assessment
year and so on: provided that where. in the case of any assessee not being a company.
the net loss computed in respect of such capital assets for any assessment year does
not exceed five thousand rupees. it shall not be carried forward under this section."commissioner of income-tax, ... vs behari lal ram charan ltd on 22 april, 1987
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/976286/ 5"(b) notwithstanding anything contained in the indian income-tax act. 1922 (11) of
1922), any loss computed under the head 'capital gains' in respect of the assessment
year.commencing on the 1st day of april. 1961. or any earlier assessment year which
is car- ried forward in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2b) of section
24 of that act. shall be dealt with in the assessment year commencing on the 1st day
of april. 1962. or any subsequent assessment year as follows:
(i) in so far as it relates to short-term capital assets, it shall be carried forward and set
off in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (i) of clause (a) and sub-sec- tion
(2): and
(ii) in so far as it relates to capital assets other than short-term capital assets. it shall
be carried forward and set off in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause
(ii) of clause (a) and sub-section (2)." "(2)(a) no loss referred to in sub-section (i) of
clause (a) of sub-section (1) or sub-clause
(i) or sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of that sub-section shall be carried forward under
this section for more than eight assessment years immediately succeeding the
assessment year for which the loss was first computed under the act or as the case
may be. the indian income-tax act. 1922 ( 11 of 1922).
"(b) no loss referred to in sub-
clause (ii)of clause (a) of sub-section (1) shall be carried forward under this section
for more than four assessment years immediate- ly succeeding the assessment year
for which the loss was first computed under the act,"
"section 80: notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, no loss which has not been
determined in pursuance of a return filed under section 139 shall be carried for- ward and set off
under sub-section (1) of section 72 or sub-section (2) of section 73 or sub-section (1) of section 74
or sub-section (3) of section 74a."
reading the provisions of section 74(1)(b} and section 80 together. we agree with the submission
advanced on behalf of the assessee that the benefit conferred under section 24 of 1922 act
continued to be given effect to under the 1961 act and notwithstanding the wordings of section 80 of
the latter act, the high court was fight in holding that the claim of set off was admissible in our
view'. on a bare analysis of these provisions, and without reference to anything more, this appeal can
be disposed of. we find that the high court reached the correct conclusion and there is no merit in
the appeal. accordingly. it is dismissed with costs.
