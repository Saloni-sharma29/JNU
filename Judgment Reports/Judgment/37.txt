indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1553220/ 2the judgment of the court was delivered by bachawat, j. the appellant and the respondent entered
into three contracts whereby the appellant agreed to buy and the respondent agreed to sell 352 bales
of cloth. originally, the contracts provided for delivery of the goods in may/june, 1948. the parties,
subsequently agreed that part of the goods would be delivered in june, 1948 and the balance goods
would be delivered in july, 1948. the dispute between the parties concerns an item of 176 bales and
another item of 46-1/2 bales. the respondent claimed from the appellant a sum of rs. 1,72,856/-
made up of (1) rs. 84,006/2/for loss in respect of 176 bales resold by the respondent with the
consent of the appellant and (2) rs. 88,849/14/- for the balance of the price of 46-1/2 bales
bargained and sold but not taken delivery of by the appellant. on february 6, 1950, the respondent
instituted against the appellant civil suit no. 10-a of 1950 in the court of the district judge, indore
claiming the aforesaid sum of rs. 1,72,856/-, interest thereon from july 1, 1948 up to january 30,
1950, godown rent, interest from the date of the institution of the suit and costs. on or about may
15, 1950, the disputes in the suit were referred to the sole arbitration of sri s. m. samvatsar,
advocate. before the arbitrator, the respondent did not press its claim for godown rent and for
interest prior to the institution of the suit, but pressed its claim for the aforesaid sum of rs.
1,72,856/and for interest from the date of the institution of the suit till recovery of the amount and
costs. one of the submissions of the appellant -before the arbitrator was that in view of a certain
control order, it could not take delivery of 46-1/2 bales, and in case it was held liable for the contract
price, it should be allowed a rebate for the current market price on its giving up its claim to the
bales. after hearing the parties, the arbitrator made his award on november 30, 1961. the award
recited the disputes between the parties and their respective contentions and submissions and then
directed that "the defendant should pay rs. 1,17,108-7-9 in all to the plaintiff and to give up claim to
46-1/2 bales. the defendant should pay interest on the above sum to the plaintiff at the rate of six
annas per cent per month from this day till the day of payment. both the parties to bear their own
costs. the plaintiff to deposit arbitration fees which amount to rs. 1740/- and to recover half of its
amount, rs. 870/from the defendant." the award was filed in court. the appellant filed an
application to set aside the award. by its order dated december 22, 1952, the district judge, indore,
dismissed the application, and passed a decree on the award. an appeal from this order preferred by
the appellant was dismissed by the high court of madhya pradesh, jabalpur. the correctness of the
judgment of the high court is challenged in this appeal by special leave. counsel for the appellant
submitted that the award should be set aside for three reasons: he submitted, firstly, that there were
errors of law apparent on the face of the award. now, the claim of the respondent consisted of two
items. the first item of claim was 84,006/2/- for loss on resale of 176 bales. the respondent's case
was that 176 bales were resold with the consent of the appellant and under the authority given by it
in a letter dated july 10, 1948. the appellant's case was that no authority for the resale of all the 176
bales was given by the letter and the resale was not made with its consent. the second item of claim
was for rs. 88,849/14/- on account of the price of 46 bales. the respondent's case was that 46-1/2
bales were sold and the property in the goods had passed to the appellant on june 30, 1948 and yet
the appellant had not taken delivery of the bales. the appellant's case was that the contract in
respect of 461 bales remained executory and it stoo cancelled on the passing of the freezing order
dated july 30, 1948 by the textile commissioner, indore under el. 25(b) of the indore cotton
textiles (control) order, 1948, whereby the respondent was directed not to deliver any cloth or yarn
from the mills'premises. the appellant submitted that, in any event, having regard to this. freezing
order it should not be held liable for the full price of 46-1/2 bales and on its giving up its claim to thefirm madanlal roshanlal mahajan vs hukumchand mills ltd., indore on 19 august, 1966
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1553220/ 3bales, should be made liable for only the difference between the contract price and the market price.
on a consideration of the contentions and submissions of the parties, the arbitrator directed the
appellant to pay rs. 1,17,108/7/9 and to give up its claim to 46-1/2 bales. as the respondent was
allowed to retain the bales, the arbitrator passed a lump sum award for rs. 1,17,108/7/9 only in
respect of both items of the respondent's claim. the arbitrator could give a lump sum award.he was
not bound to give a separate award for each claim.his award on both fact and law is final. there is
no appeal from his verdict. the court cannot review his award and correct any mistake in his
adjudication, unless an objection to the legality of the award is apparent on the face of it. in
champsey bhara & company.v v. jivraj balloo spinning and wearing company ltd.(1), the privy
council stated:
"an error in law on the face of the award means, in their lordship's view, that you
can find in the award or a document actually incorporated thereto, as for instance a
note (1) l. r. 50 1. a. 324.
appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his judgment, some legal
proposition which is the basis of the award and which you can then say is erroneous."
in the present case, the arbitrator gave no reason for the award. we do not find in the award any
legal proposition which is the basis of the award, far less a legal proposition which is erroneous. it is
not possible to say from the award that the arbitrator was under a misconception of law. the
contention that there are errors of law on the face of the award is rejected.
counsel then submitted that by amending an issue behind the back of the appellant, the arbitrator
was guilty of misconduct, this contention has no force. the arbitrator had raised two issues. the
second issue referred to the respondent's claim in respect of 46-1/2 bales -s a claim for loss in
respect of the bales. at the time of the writing of the award, the arbitrator corrected this issue so as
to show that the claim was for the price of the bales. by this amendment, the appellant suffered no
prejudice. the parties well knew that the respondent claimed the price of 46-1/2 bales and fought
the case before the arbitrator on that footing.
the last objection to the award is that the arbitrator had no power to award interest during the
pendency of the suit. in support of this objection, counsel for the appellant relied upon the following
observations of bose, j. in seth thawardas pherumal v. the union of india (1):
"it was suggested that at least interest from the date of suit' could be awarded on the
analogy of section 34 of the civil procedure code, 1908. but section 34 does not apply
because an arbitrator is not a 'court' within the meaning of the code nor does the
code apply to arbitrators, and, but for section 34, even a court would not have the
power to give interest after the suit. this was, therefore, also rightly struck out from
the award."
these observations divorced from their context, lend colour to the argument that the arbitrator has
no power to award pendente lite interest. but, in later cases, this court has pointed out that thefirm madanlal roshanlal mahajan vs hukumchand mills ltd., indore on 19 august, 1966
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1553220/ 4observations in seth thawardas's case (1) were not intended to lay down such a broad and
unqualified proposition, see nachiappa chettiar v. subramaniam chettiar (2), satinder singh v.
amrao singh (3). the relevant facts regarding the claim for interest in seth thawardas's case(1) will
be found at pp. 64 to 66 of the report and in paragraphs 2, 17 and 24 of the judgment of the patna
high court reported in union of india v. premchand satram das (4). the arbitrator awarded on
unliquidated damages for a (1) [1955] 2 s. c. r. 48,65.

period before the reference to arbitration and also for a period subsequent to the reference. the
high court set aside the award regarding interest on the ground that the claim for interest was not
referred to arbitration and the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim. in this court,
counsel for the claimant contended that the arbitrator had statutory power under the interest act of
1839 to award the interest and, in any event, he had power to award interest during the pendency of
the arbitration proceedings under s. 34 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. bose, j. rejected this
contention. it will be noticed that the judgment of this court in seth thawardas's case(1) is silent on
the question whether the arbitrator can award interest during the pendency of arbitration
proceedings if the claim regarding interest is referred to arbitration. in the present case, all the
disputes in the suit were referred to the arbitrator for his decision. one of the disputes in the suit
was whether the respondent was entitled to pendente lite interest. the arbitrator could decide the
dispute and he could award pendente lite interest just as a court could do so under s. 34 of the code
of civil procedure. though, in terms, s. 34 of the code of civil procedure does not apply to
arbitrations, it was an implied term of the reference in the suit that the arbitrator would decide the
dispute according to law and would give such relief with regard to pendente lite interest as the court
could give if it decided the dispute. this power of the arbitrator was not fettered either by the
arbitration agreement or by the arbitration act, 1940. the contention that in an arbitration in a suit
the arbitrator had no power to award pendente lite interest must be rejected. in the result, the
appeal is dismissed with costs.
y. p.                            appeal dismissed.
