(crl.) 508 of 1989 and slp (crl.)

http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1355334/ 7subject to the maximum period permissible under the act. in every case where the advisory board has reported that there is in its opinion no sufficient cause for the detention of the person, the government shall revoke the detention order and release the person forthwith. section 11 provides power to the state government or the central government to revoke the detention order without prejudice to the provisions of section 21 of the general clauses act. it is now beyond the pale of controversy that the constitutional right to make representation under clause (5) of article 22 by necessary implication guarantees the constitutional right to a proper consideration of the representation. secondly, the obligation of the government to afford to the detenu an opportunity to make representation and to consider such representation is distinct from the government\\'s obligation to refer the case of detenu along with the representation to the advisory board to enable it to form its opinion and send a report to the government. it is implicit in clauses (4) and (5) of article 22 that the government while discharging its duty to consider the representation, cannot depend upon the views of the board on such representation. it has to consider the representation on its own without being influenced by any such view of the board. the obligation of the government to consider the representation is different from the obligation of the board to consider the representation at the time of hearing the references. the government considers the representation to ascertain essentially whether the order is in conformity with the power under the law. the board, on the other hand, considers the representation and the case of the detenu to examine whether there is sufficient case for detention. the consideration by the board is an additional safeguard and not a substitute for consideration of the representation by the government. the right to have the representation considered by the government, is, safeguarded by cl. (5) of article 22 and it is independent of the consideration of the detenu\\'s case and his representation by the advisory board under cl. (4) of art. (see: sk. v. state of west bengal and ors.,[1975] 1 scr 778. the representation relates to the liberty of the individual, the highly cherished right enshrined in article 21 of our constitution. clause (5) of article 22 therefore, casts a legal obligation on the government to consider the representation as early as possible. it is a constitutional mandate commanding the concerned authority to whom the detenu submits his representation to consider the representation and dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible. abdulla kunhi and b.l. abdul   vs union of india and ors., state of   on 23 january, 1991 indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1355334/ 8there is no period prescribed either under the constitution or under the concerned detention law, within which the representation should be dealt with. any unexplained delay in the disposal of representation would be a breach of the constitutional imperative and it would render the continued detention impermissible and illegal. ray, j., as he then was, speaking for the constitution bench has laid down four principles which should govern the consideration of representation of detenus (at p.224): \"first the appropriate authority is bound to give an opportunity to the detenu to make a representation and to consider the representation of the detenu as early as possible. secondly, the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the appropriate authority is entirely independent of any action by the advisory board including the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the advisory board. fourthly, the appropriate government is to exercise its opinion and judgment on the representation before sending the case along with the detenu\\'s representation to the advisory board. if the appropriate government will release the detnu the government will not send the matter to the advisory board. if, however, the government will not release the detenu the government will send the case along with the detenu\\'s representation to the advisory board. if thereafter the advisory board will express an opinion in favour of release of the detenu the government will release the detenu. if the the advisory board will express any opinion against the release of the detnu the government may still exercise the power to release the detenu.\" one may well imagine a case where a detenu does not make representation before the board makes its report making it impossible for the detaining authority either to consider it or to forward it to the board in time or a case where a detenu makes a representation to the detaining authority so shortly before the advisory board takes up the reference that the detaining authority cannot consider the representation before then but may merely forward it to the board without himself considering it. abdulla kunhi and b.l. abdul   vs union of india and ors., state of   on 23 january, 1991 indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1355334/ 9indifference. in frances coralie mullin\\'s case the detenu\\'s representation was received by the detaining authority on december 26, 1979. without any loss of time copy of the representation was sent to the customs- authorities for their remarks which was obviously necessary because the information leading to the order of detention was collected by the customs authorities. the comments of the customs authorities were received on january 4, 1980. the advisory board was meeting on january 4, 1980 and so there could be no question of the detaining authority considering the representation of detenu before the board met, unless it was done in a great and undue haste. after obtaining the comments of the customs authorities, it was found necessary to take legal advice as the representation posed many legal and constitutional question, so, after consultation with the secreatary (law and judicial) delhi administration, the representation was finally rejected by the administrator or january 15, 1980. it was held that if there appeared to be any delay it was not due to any want of care but because the representation required a thorough examination in consultation with investigation agencies and advisers of law we agree with the observations in frances coralie mullin case. the representation may be received before the case is referred to the advisory board, but there may not be time to dispose of the representation before referring the case to the advisory board. in that situation the representation must also be forwarded to the advisory board along with the case of the detenu. the representation may be received after the case of the detenu isreferred to the board. even in this situation the representation should be forwarded to the advisory board provided the board has not concluded the proceedings. in both the situations there is no question of consideration of the representation before the receipt of report of the advisory board. nor it could be said that the government has delayed consideration of the representation, unnecessarily awaiting the report of the board. it is proper for the government in such situations to await the report of the board. if the board finds no material for detention on the merits andreports accordingly, the government is bound to revoke the order of detention. secondly, even if the board expresses the view that there is sufficient cause for detention, the government after considering the representation could revoke the detention. it is therefore, proper that the government considers the representation in the aforesaid two situations only after the receipt of the report of the board. if the representation is received by the government after the advisory board has made its report, there could then of course be no question of sending the representation to the advisory board. abdulla kunhi and b.l. abdul   vs union of india and ors., state of   on 23 january, 1991 indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1355334/ 10the crucial question that remains for consideration is whether the government should consider and dispose of the representation before confirming the detention. jain case has observed (at 405) that it is a constitutional obligation under clause (5) of article 22 to consider the representation before confirming the order of detention. if it is not so considered, the confirmation becomes invalid and the subsequent consideration and rejection of the representation could not cure the invalidity of the order of confirmation. to reach this conclusion, the court has relied upon two earlier judgments of this court: (i) khudiram das v. state of west bengal and ors., [1975] 2 scc 81 and (ii) khairul haque v. state of west bengal, w.p. it was a case of belated consideration of the representation without acceptable explanation. there the petitioner was detained by an order dated 5 june 1969 of the district magistrate, 24 parganas, west bengal, under section 3(2) of the preventive detention act, 1950. he was arrested and detained in dum dum central jail on 6 june 1969. the district magistrate informed the state government of his said order on 9 june 1969. on 14 june 1969, the governor gave his approval and reported the case of the central government. on or about 23 june 1969, the government received the representation of the petitioner. on 30 june 1969 the governor referred the case of the petitioner to the advisory board. the advisory board made its report on 11 august 1969 to the effect that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner. the court while referring these facts said that there was unaccounted delay of little more than two months in the consideration of the representation . doubtless the detention was invalid on this delay alone and the court could have quashed the detention on that ground. but the court, however, observed that it is doubtful whether the government\\'s consideration of the representation was independent as implicit in the language of article 22(5). if the confirmation by the government of the order of the district magistrate is made first and the government rejects the representation thereafter, such rejection is not an independent consideration but as the result of its decision to confirm the order of detention. it was also observed that the process of decision-making has to be the other way about, that is to say, the government must first consider the representation and only later decide whether it should confirm the order of the district magistrate on the basis of the report of the advisory board. (5) of article 22, much less any statutory requirement to consider the representation before confirming the order of detention. as long as the government without delay considers the representation with an unbiased mind there is no basis for concluding that the absence of independent consideration is the obvious result if the representation is not considered before the confirmation of detention. as observed earlier, the government\\'s consideration of the representation is for a different purpose, namely to find out whether the detention is ink.m. abdulla kunhi and b.l. abdul   vs union of india and ors., state of   on 23 january, 1991 indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1355334/ 11conformity with the power under the statute. this has been explained in haradhan saha case, where ray, c.j., speaking for the constitution bench observed that the consideration of the representation by the government is only to ascertain whether the detention order is in conformity with the power under the law. there need not be a speaking order in disposing such representation. it may be borne in mind that the confirmation of detention does not preclude the government from revoking the order of detention upon considering the representation. secondly, there may be cases where the government has to consider the representation only after confirmation of detention. clause (5) of article 22 suggests that the representation could be received even after confirmation of the order of detention. the words \\'shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order\\' in clause (5) of article 22 suggest that the obligation of the government is to offer the detenu an opportunity of making a representation against the order, before it is confirmed according to the procedure laid down under section 8 of the act. but if the detenu does not exercise his right to make representation at that stage, but presents it to the government after the government has confirmed the order of detention, the government still has to consider such representation and release the detenu if the detention is not within the power conferred under the statute. the confirmation ofthe order of detention is not conclusive as against the detenu. it can be revoked suo motu under section 11 or upon a representation of the detenu. it seems to us therefore, that so long as the representation is independently considered by the government and if there is no delay in considering the representation, the fact that it is considered after the confirmation of detention makes little difference on the validity of the detention or confirmation of the detention. the confirmation cannot be invalidated solely on the ground that the representation is considered subsequent to confirmation of the detention. counsel however, submitted that the representation of the detenu was not sent to the advisory board for consideration. abdulla kunhi and b.l. abdul   vs union of india and ors., state of   on 23 january, 1991 indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1355334/ 12'"
