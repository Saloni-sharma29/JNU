Dalai and R.B. Dalai, for the appellant.\\nC.K. Daphtary, Solicitor General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the Republic of India (respondent No. 1).Jindra Lal for the respondent No. 2. 1952.\\nFebruary 1.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.\\nThe facts out of which this Crimi nal Appeal has arisen are not long.\\nThe appellant, W.H. King, who is carrying on a business in Bombay under the name and style of Associated Commercial Enterprises, was the tenant of a flat on the second floor of a building called \"Ganga Vihar\", Marine Drive, Bombay, which belongs to a lady named Durgeshwari Devi.\\nThe tenancy was a monthly one, the rent being Rs. 215.\\nIt is said that the appellant wanted to go to the United Kingdom for treatment of his failing eye sight and he got into touch with the complainant Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia, who is the second respondent in this appeal, through one Sayed for the purpose of making necessary ar rangements about the flat occupied by him in view of his intended departure.\\nThe prosecution case is that the accused demanded a sum of Rs. 30,000 which was later on reduced to Rs. 29,500 as consideration for putting the complainant in vacant possession of the flat and an additional amount of Rs. 2,000 for the furniture, and that the complainant agreed to pay these sums.\\nThe complainant actually paid the accused two sums of 420 Rs. 500 each on 7th November, 1948, and 17th November, 1948.\\nHe, however, got into touch with the police on 1 12 1948, and in conjunction with the latter, a trap was laid for the appellant.\\nIt was arranged that the complainant should bring with him Rs. 1,000, being the balance due in respect of the furniture and that the police would give him Rs. 29,500 to be paid to the appellant.\\nThe complainant and a Sub Inspec tor, posing as the complainant \\'s brother, went to the appel lant on 4 12 1948, and paid him the two sums of money; and the keys of the flat and the motor garage were handed over to the complainant.\\nAs the appellant and his wife were leaving the flat, the man, who masqueraded as the complain ant \\'s brother, threw off his disguise and disclosed his identity.\\nThe police party, who were down below ready for the raid, held up the car of the appellant and recovered the sum of Rs. 30,500 from the rear seat of the car and also some papers, a typed draft of a partnership agreement be tween the complainant and the appellant and an application form for permission to occupy the building as caretaker.\\nFrom the complainant were recovered the bunch of keys and the documents that were handed over to him by the appellant, namely, the letter handing vacant possession (Exhibit D).\\nthe receipt for Rs. 2,000 for the articles of furniture (Exhibit E), a letter to the Bombay Gas Company for transfer of the gas connection to the name of the complainant (Exhib it F), and the letter to the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Committee for transfer of the telephone connec tions and the deposit of Rs. 27 (Exhibit G).\\nThe appellant was charged under section 18(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVII of 1947, for receiving a pugree of Rs. 29,500 and he was further charged under section 19(2) of the said Act for receiving the said sum as a condition for the relin quishment of his tenancy.\\nHis wife, who was the second accused in the case, was charged with aiding and abetting her husband in the commission of the two offences.\\n421 The defence of the appellant was that he was in search of a partner to carry on his business during his intended absence, who was also to act as caretaker of his flat anal that it was in this connection and with this object in view that he entered into negotiations with the complain ant.\\nThe sum of Rs. 29 500 was not pugree but represented capital for 0 12 0 share in the business and as the com plainant was also to be a caretaker of the flat, the sum of Rs. 2,000 was paid and received as a guarantee against disposal and damage of the furniture and it was agreed to be paid back on the appellant \\'s return to India.\\nThe wife of the appellant denied any aiding and abetting.\\nThe Presidency Magistrate, who tried the case, disbe lieved the defence on the facts, holding that what was received by the accused was by way of pugree.\\nAs section 18 (1) of the Act was not applicable he convicted him under section 19(2) of the Act and sentenced him, in view of his old age and blindness, to one day \\'s simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 30,000.\\nThe wife was acquitted, the evidence being insufficient to prove any abetment.\\nThe appellant preferred an appeal to the High Court of Bombay but it was summarily dismissed on 20 2 1950.\\nHe asked for a certificate under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution but this was rejected on 10 4 1950.\\nThereaf ter he applied for special leave to appeal to this Court and it was granted on 3 10 1950.\\nA short legal argument was advanced on behalf of the appellant based on the language of section 19 (1) of the Act and this is the only point which requires our consideration.\\nThe section which consists of two parts is in these terms:\" \"(1) It shall not be lawful for the tenant or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the tenant to claim or receive any sum or any consideration as a condi tion for the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises; 422 (2) Any tenant or person who in contravention of the provisions of sub section (1) receives any sum or considera tion shall, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months and shall also be pun ished with fine which shall not be less than the sum or the value of the consideration received by him.\\n\" It was urged that the offence arises only on receipt of any sum or any consideration as a condition of the relin quishment by a tenant of his tenancy and that in the present case there was no such relinquishment.\\nExhibit D, which is the most material document, under which the appellant handed over vacant possession of the flat to the complainant, constitutes or evidences an assignment of the tenancy and not a relinquishment.\\nIt says : \"I, W.H. King, hereby hand over vacant possession of my flat No. 3 situated on 2nd floor and garage No. 4 on the ground floor of Ganga Vihar Building on Plot No. 55 situated on Marine Drive Road to Mr. Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia from this day onward and that I have no claim whatsoever over this flat and Mr. Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia will pay the rent directly to the landlord.\\n\" The argument raised on behalf of the appellant appears to us to be sound and has to be accepted.\\nThe learned Solic itor General urged that \\'the word \"relinquishment\" was not a term of art and was used in the section not in any strict technical sense but in its comprehensive meaning as giving up of possession of the premises; and he pointed out that if it was intended by the legislature that \"relinquish ment\" should have the limited meaning sought to be placed upon it on behalf of the appellant, the word \"surrender\" used in the Transfer of Property Act would have been more appropriate.\\nSections 15 and 18 of the Act were referred to in this connection but in our opinion they lend no assist ance to the argument of the learned counsel.\\nAny sublet ting, assignment or transfer in any other manner of his interest by the tenant is made unlawful under 423 section 15.\\nSection 18 deals with the grant, renewal or continuance of a lease of any premises or the giving of his consent by the landlord to the transfer of a lease by sub lease or otherwise, and it provides that the landlord, who receives any fine, premium, or other like sum or deposit, or any consideration for the grant, renewal or continuance or the accord of consent oh would be guilty of an offence and liable to the punishment therein specified.\\nIt would thus be seen that an assignment of the lease or transfer in any other manner by a tenant is not made an offence; the statute merely says that it is not a lawful transaction.\\nIt is the landlord \\'s consent to the transfer of a lease by sub lease or otherwise on receipt of consideration that has been made an offence.\\nThen follows section 19 which speaks of the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises by a tenant.\\nIf, by the expression, an assignment such as we have in the present case was meant, appropriate words could have been used, such as the transfer by a tenant of his interest, which we find in section 108, sub clause (i), of the Trans fer of Property Act.\\nThe distinction between an assignment on the one hand and relinquishment or surrender on the other is too plain to be ignored.\\nIn the case of an assignment, the assignor contin ues to be liable to the landlord for the performance of his obligations under the tenancy and this liability is contrac tual, while the assignee becomes liable by reason of privity of estate.\\nThe consent of the landlord to an assignment is not necessary, in the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary.\\nBut in the case of relinquishment, it cannot be a unilateral transaction; it can only be in favour of the lessor by mutual agreement between them.\\nThe relin quishment of possession must be to the lessor or one who holds his interest.\\nIn fact, a surrender or relinquishment terminates the lessee \\'s rights and lets in the lessor.\\nIt is no doubt true that the word \"relinquishment\" does not occur in the Transfer of Property Act but it is found in many of the Tenancy Acts in various provinces where there are Sec tions which deal with the 55 424 relinquishment of their holdings by tenants in favour of the landlord by notice given to him in writing.\\nThe section in question, it should be further noted, does not speak of relinquishment or giving up of possession,in general terms.\\nThe words are \"the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises\".\\nThe relinquishment of a tenancy is equivalent to surrender by the lessee or tenant of his rights as such.\\nWhether abandonment of a tenancy would come within the meaning of relinquishment is a question that does not arise in this appeal, because in the face of Exhibit D, there is no abandonment in the sense that the tenant disappeared from the scene altogether saying nothing and making no arrange ments about his interest and possession under the lease.\\nAs the statute creates an offence and imposes a penalty of fine and imprisonment, the words of the section must be strictly construed in favour of the subject.\\nWe are not concerned so much with what might possibly have been intend ed as with what has been actually said in and by the language employed.\\nAs in our view, there has been no \"relinquishment\" within the meaning of section 19, sub clause (1), the conviction under sub clause (2) cannot be sustained.\\nIt is set aside and the fine of Rs. 30,000 will be refunded if it has al ready been paid.\\nThe other parts of the order of the learned Presidency Magistrate, as regards the disposal of Rs. 1,000 paid by the complainant to the appellant and the sum of Rs. 29,500 brought in by the police, will, however, stand.\\nConviction sit aside.\\nAgent for respondent No. 1: P.A. Mehta.\\nAgent for respondent No. 2: Ganpat Rai.\\n'"

Etg.\\nvs Workers of the Company.\\netc.) (1).\\nIt was of opinion that even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides is essential and if the terminataton of service is a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour praction the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nFurther it held that where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice.\\nThese observations 827 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal were approved by this Court in The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees \\' Union (1).\\nand Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen (2).\\nTherefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r. 21 deals with case of misconduct and provides for dismissal or suspension for misconduct and in such a case the workman so suspended is not entitled to any wages during the period of suspension.\\nThe claim thus put forward on behalf of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) it is now well settled, in view of the decisions cited above, that the employer could defend the action under r'"

The State took an appeal to the High Court and the judgment of acquittal was reversed and of the accused persons the two appellants were convicted and the others were acquitted. The appeal has been filed by H.J. Umrigar and B.H. Dhebar on behalf of the Andheri Marol Kurla Bus Service who was accused No. 1 (now appellant No. 1) and its Manager H.M. Khan. The question for decision is whether conciliation proceedings could be said to be pending when Louis Pereira was dismissed. The appellants have appealed by special leave. If the answer is in the affirmative then they have been properly convicted and if not the conviction must be set aside. Section 31(1) makes the contravention of the provision of section 33 of the Act an offence with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine or with both. The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of that section provides as to when the'"

(4) Where the person who was at the commencement of the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1939 carrying on any business, profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918, is succeeded in such capacity by another person, the change not being merely a change in the constitution of a partnership, no tax shall be payable by the first mentioned person in respect of the income, profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such succession Both these sub sections gave a further right to the assessee but with that right we are not concerned and shall, there fore, make no more reference to it. (4) of section 25 is that the business must have been charged to tax under the Indian Income tax Act, 1918. The second condition of the applicability of section 25(4) is that business must have been carried on at the commencement of the Indian Income tax Act (Amendment) Act, 1939, that is, April 1, 1939, by the person claiming the relief. It contends that it had been carrying on a business on April 1, 1939 from before and on that business tax had been charged under the Act of 1918 and that it was succeeded by a company as owner of the business as a result of a transfer by an instrument executed on February 7, 1948. Its case is that under annexure C I an outsider Hemchand was admitted as partner in some of the businesses of the existing partner ship, namely, the umbrella and soap businesses and by the other instrument, annexure C 11, the other existing businesses of that partnership, e.g., in yarn, piece goods, money lending etc., were, continued by the subsisting partners mentioned above. The contention of the respondent, on the other hand, is that these two instruments show that the business of the existing firm had been split up into two and transferred to two different owners, namely, two newly constituted firms with different partners, some of whom were no doubt common, and this amounted to a discontinuance of the business of the old firm. It was contended that after such discontinuance it could not be said that the same business on which tax had been charged under the Act of 1918 was being carried on on April 1, 1939 and no question, therefore, of any subsequent succession to that business to make sub sec. There is no doubt that as a result of the instrument of February 7, 1948 the Company succeeded to the business that was being carried on by the firm of Nagjee, Purushotham and Company as then constituted as aforesaid, as bankers, piece goods and yarn merchants and as soap and umbrella manufacturers and sellers. The question, however is, was this firm a firm which had been carrying on a business on April 1, 1939 and which business had been charged to tax under the Act of 1918? (2) Narayanjee(3) Maneklal and (4) Hemchand(hereinafter called the partners) witnesseth asfollows: Whereas Partners 1 to 4 have been carrying on a business as partners from the beginning of Samvat 1994 (=October November 1937) in 101 the manufacture and sale of Soaps under the name of \\'The Vegetable Soap Works \\' Proprietor Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., and in the manufacture and sale of umbrellas in Calicut with branches at Madras and Bombay under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., Soap and Umbrella Merchants at Calicut and Madras and in the name of Sha Nagjee Purushotham & Co., at Bombay hereinafter called the Firm; And whereas it is thought advisable to reduce the terms of the said partnership into writing for the proper and better conduct of the business; The Partners have agreed and also hereby agree to the following: (1) The Firm shall continue to be as of old namely Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., Soap and Umbrella Merchants. The Firm shall continue to do business in the manufacture and sale of soaps under the name of the \\'Vegetable Soap Works \\' and in umbrellas under the name of \\'Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., S oap and Umbrella Merchants as aforesaid with Head Office at Calicut and branch at Madras under the same name and branch at Bombay under the name of \\'Sha Nagjee Purushotham & Co. . (8)It is always understood by the Partners herein that the Firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham 102 & Co., Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn mer chants, Calicut, the partners whereof are the: Partners 1 to 3 herein shall advance as, heretofore all funds that are necessary for the conduct of this Partnership Such advances shall be deemed as loan by the firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn Merchants to the., Firm . settled the claims in full of the partners who ceased to exist and agreed to carry on and continue and are continuing the existing partnership business under the name and style of \\'Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co. \\' Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn Merchants, hereinafter called the \\'Firm \\'; and Whereas it is thought advisable and prudent to reduce into writing the terms and conditions agreed upon orally by them the Partners agree and have agreed to the following terms and regulations stipulated hereunder. (20) All the partners hereby agree that they in their individual capacity are and shall be Partners also along with Hemchand Veerjee Sait in a Partnership business in Soaps and Umbrellas carried on in Calicut and Madras under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co., Soap and Umbrella Merchants and in Bombay under the name and style of Shah Nagjee Purushotham & Co., the terms and conditions whereof are embodied in an Agreement of Partnership dated 30 5 1939 signed by all the Partners. 1 that \"The Firm shall continue to do business\" refers to the continuance of the business carried on prior to May 30, 1939 by the firm brought into existence in October/November 1937 by the oral agreement. There is no warrant for the view for which the appellant contended, that only the terms on which the business under the document of December 6, 1918 was carried were revoked and not the head agreement to do business in partnership. That clause states that the partners in their individual capacity would be partners with Hemchand in another business the terms of which partnership appear in another partnership agreement of the same date and which is annexure C 1. The two instruments annexure C I and C 11, therefore, clearly establish that in October/November 1937 the business that was carried on by the firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co. till that date, was discontinued and its businesses were split up into two and carried on by two independent partnerships then brought into existence. This view finds support from section N. A. section A. Annamalai Chettiar vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras(1) where it was held that when a business carried on in one unit is disintegrated and divided into parts, the parts are not the whole even though all the parts taken together constitute the whole. \\'It was held that as a result of this splitting up there was a discontinuance of the original business at the date of the partition and on such discontinuance the family became entitled to relief under section 25(3) It is of some significance to point out that the partners constituting the appellant at the moment of the transfer in 1948 also thought that in 1937 the old firm ceased to exist and its business was carried on thereafter by two independent firms, for the document of October 30, 1943 has referred to annexures C 1 and C 11 as constituting two independent partnerships and proceeded to revoke them both and provided that the parties to the instrument \"have (1) 107 agreed to carry on and continue as one single partnership business the existing partnership businesses of Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co., Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn Mer chants, Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co., Soap and Umbrella Merchants. \" That being so, there can be no question of the succession to the business carried on at the commencement of the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1939, that is, April 1, 1939 and on which tax was charged under the Act of 1918 having taken place in 1948 as claimed by the appellant. In the deed of 1918, it was stated that this firm carried on business in Calicut, having branches at Madras and Bombay and though Manecklal was included as a new partner, the firm was to carry on and continue the existing partnership business under the same name and style. Sometime in the year 1932 or thereabout, the firm had started the manufacture and sale of soaps under the name of \"The Vegetable Soap Works\" Proprietors Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co. and perhaps the manufacture and sale of umbrellas in Calicut with branches at Madras and Bombay under the name and style, at Calicut and Madras, of \"Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co. In Cl the preamble was as follows: \"Whereas Partners 1 to 4 have been carrying on a business as Partners from the beginning of Samvat 1994 (Guzarathi Era) in the manufacture and sale of Soaps under the name of \"The Vegetable Soap Works\" Proprietors Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., and in the manufacture and sale of Umbrellas in Calicut with branches at Madras and Bombay under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., Soap and Umbrella Merchants at Calicut and Madras and in the name of Sha Nagjee Purushotham & Co. at Bombay hereinafter called the Firm. \" 15,000 as deposit in the Firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn Merchants, Calicut and such money shall remain in deposit as long as he remains a Partner and such amount shall carry interest at such rates of interest as the Firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., Bankers, Piecegoods and Yarn Merchants may agree from time to time. \" Whereas the remaining partners (1) Nagjee Amersee Sait, (2) Narayanji Purushotham Sait and (3) Manecklal Purushotham Sait settled the claims in full of the partners who ceased to exist and agreed to carry on and continue and are continuing the existing partnership business under the name and style of \"Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co.\" Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn Merchants, hereinafter called the \"FIRM\" 112 The relevant terms were: \"2. All the partners hereby agree that they in their individual capacity are and shall be Partners also along with Hemchand Veerji Sait in a Partnership business in Soaps and Umbrellas carried on in Calicut and Madras under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., Soap and Umbrella Merchants and in Bombay under the name and style of Shah, Nagjee Purushotham & Co. the terms and conditions whereof are embodied in an Agreement of Partnership dated 30 5 1939 signed by all the Partners.\" 113 And whereas the remaining partners along with the new partners now included in the Deed of Partnership, have agreed to carry on and con tinue as one, single partnership business, the existing partnership businesses of \"Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co., Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn merchants, \"Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co. And whereas it is thought advisable and prudent to reduce into writing the terms and conditions agreed upon orally by them the partners agree and have agreed to the following terms and conditions stipulated hereunder : The operative terms relevant to our purposes were the following: \"The Agreements of Partnerships dated 30th May 1939 entered into by (1) Nagjee Amersee Sait, (2) Narayanjee Purushotham Sait (3) Maneck lal Purushotham Sait and (1) Nagjee Amersee Sait (2) Narayanji Purushotham Sait (3) Manecklal Purushotham Sait and (4) Hemchand Veerji Sait and registered as 98 and 97 in the Joint 11 Sub Registrar \\'s Office, Calicut respectively, are hereby revoked and the affairs of the firm shall be regulated and governed by the regulations agreed upon orally and reduced into writing in this deed of Partnership; and the terms and conditions of the revo ked Deed shall not in future apply to the Firm except such as have been repeated in this Deed. 2.The partners of the firm are (1) Narayanjee Purushotham Sait, (2) Manecklal Purshotham Sait, (3) Jayanand Nagjee Sait (Minor) represented by guardian Manecklal Purushotham Sait (4) Leeladhar Narayanjee Sait and (5) Prabhulal Narayanjee Sait.\" The answer to the question depends on (a) whether the business on which tax was paid under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918 had discontinued at any time before 1948 or (b) whether there was a succession by another person for the person who was carrying on business on April 1, 1939. I shall therefore address myself to the questions (a) whether there was a succession in 1948 for the first time when the company succeeded the firm, to entitle the firm to the benefits of section 25 (4): (b) whether there was, prior to 1948, a discontinuance of the business on which tax was charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act and (c) whether there was, prior to 1948, succession by another person to the person who had paid the tax under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1918 after April 1, 1939? The first sub section lays down how the business is to be assessed when it is discontinued in any year and sub section 2 provides that any person discontinuing business must give a notice on pain of a penalty. Sub section (3) and sub section (4) in so far as it is relevant for our purpose, are as follows: Sub section (3) \"Where any business, profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918 (VII of 1918), is discontinued, then unless there has been a succession by virtue of which the provisions of sub section (4) have been rendered applicable no tax shall be payable in respect of the income, profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such discontinuance, and the assessee may further claim that the income, profits and gains of the previous year shall be deemed to have been the income, profits and gains of the said period. Sub section (4) \"Where the person who was at the commencement of the Indian Income tax(Amendment) Act, 1939 (VII of 1939), carrying on any business, profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918, is succeeded in such capacity by another person, the change not being merely a change in the constitution of a partnership, no tax shall be payable by the 116 first mentioned person in respect of the income, profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such succession, and such person may further claim that the income, profits and gains of the previous year shall be deemed to have been the income, profits and gains of the said period. Sub section (4) was inserted by the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1939 (VII of 1939), which also introduced the words underlined in sub section Sub section (4) and the amendment to sub section (3) were to come into force from April 1, 1939 by virtue of notification No. Under section 3 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918, the subject of the tax was not the income of the previous year of assessment, but the income of the assessment year. The Tribunal also held that the business in soap and umbrella was different from the business of banking, piece goods and yarn, and the amalgamation of these two businesses in 1943 amounted to a succession by a newly constituted firm. The two sub sections which have been quoted apply differently, because in sub section (3) the emphasis is on the discontinuance of the business which had paid tax under the 1918 Act while the emphasis in sub section (4) is on succession to a person who, on April J., 1939, was carrying on any business on which tax was at any time charged under the Act of 1918. The former regards the continuity of the business which had paid tax under the Act of 1918 and the latter the continuance of the person who, on April 1, 1939, was carrying on the business which had paid such tax. The question that arises is whether there was at any time a dissolution of the partnership and if so, whether; it 118 amounted to \"discontinuance\" of business for the application of sub section (3) or a succession by the formation of an entirely new firm for the application of sub section For this purpose, I shall first discuss what is the position of a partnership under the ordinary law of partnership and under the Income tax Act. The Indian Partnership Act has accepted the English Common Law though mercantile usages have crept into business accountancy and the Civil Procedure Code allows a firm to sue or be sued in the firm \\'s name provided the names of the partners are disclosed. Under the Income tax Act, however, a firm is by section 3 made a unit or assessment, but this personality does not make the firm a person in every sense of the word. The first sub section deals with a change in the constitution of the firm or where a firm has been newly constituted and the second sub section where there is a succession to the person (which includes a firm) (1) (2) [1956] section C. R. 154. Discontinuance is thus not a mere change in the constitution of the firm nor even succession where, though the business changes hands, the business itself is carried on. It was recently pointed out by us in Shivram Poddar vs Income tax Officer, Calcutta and another(1) thus: \"Under the ordinary law governing partnerships, modification in the constitution of the firm in the absence of a special agreement to the contrary amounts to dissolution of the firm and reconsitution thereof, a firm at common law being a group of individuals who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all, and supersession of the agreement brings about an end of the rela tion. A firm discontinuing its business may be assessed in the manner provided by section 25 (1) in the year of account in which it discontinues its business; it may also be assessed in the year of assessment. Where the firm is dissolved, but the business is not dis continued, there being change in the constitu tion of the firm, assessment has to be made under section 26 (1), and if there be succession to the business, assessment has to be made under section 26 (2). \" 120 must, in the past, have been assessed to tax under the Act of 1918, sub section (4) allows a partnership to obtain the benefits of sub section (4) when there is a succession and a partnership does not loose this benefit if there has been a mere change in the constitution of the partnership without there being a succession. In this way all cases of discontinuance of business are treated under the 3rd sub section and all cases of succession under the fourth sub section and all cases of mere change in the constitution of the firm, are neither cases under the third nor under the fourth subsections. These facts are fundamental, because, if the umbrella and soap business were never assessed to tax under the Act of 1918, they are out of the picture and in respect of these businesses, the assessee firm was not at all entit (1) (2) ; 121 led to relief. Chief Justice Chagla observed at p. 287 thus: \"But before us we have a clear and categorical finding that the three businesses of the assessee were distinct businesses and, therefore, it cannot be stated that the relief which was intended for the money lending business which was carried on by the assessee and which was subjected to tax under t he Act of 1918 should be extended to the business of running the ginning factory and the share business which were not in existence and which were not subjected to tax under the Act of 1918. On March 28, 1939, there was a family partition and some vilasams were allotted to the father and the rest to the son, and he was the assessee \\' In the assessment year 1939 40, the son claimed that there was a discontinuance of the business within the meaning of section 25(3) of the Income tax Act, 1922 and claimed the benefit of that sub section on the ground that the business of them joint family was taxed under the Act of 1918 and he was not liable to pay tax for the period between April 13, 1938 and March 28, 1939. The Income tax Act thinks, not in terms of joint family business, but in terms of business in a business sense, and it is the business which was taxed under the Act of 1918 which must cease to exist before the benefit of section 25(3) can be obtained. While it is possible that there may be a succession only to the business which had paid tax under the Act of 1918 for purposes of section 25(4), as is the case here, a complete change of ownership of all the businesses is necessary for purposes of section 26(2) before it can be said that there is succession. The business of (1) 129 umbrella and soap which never paid tax under the Act of 1918 could be dealt with by the partners as they liked without affecting the question of relief under section 25 in respect ,of the head business. In my judgment, these appeals must be allowed anD the question answered in favour of the assessee firm but only in respect of the business in piece goods, yarn and banking which alone had paid tax under the Income tax Act of 1918.'"

I was asked to appear before the Conciliation Officer on January 9, 1952, and after getting one adjournment the appellant No. On May 9, 1952, the Union had also indicated to the Conciliation Officer that the negotiations had failed. The argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that the object of conciliation is to get a settlement made with expedition and therefore under section 12 the Conciliation Officer was bound to make his report within 14 days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings or within such shorter period fixed by the appropriate Government. That sub section is as follows: section 20(1). . . . . . . . .

J. Kolah and I. N. Shroff for the appellant.\\nG. N. Joshi, Porus A. Mehta and R. H. Dhebar for the respondent.\\nMay 10.\\nThe following Judgments were delivered.\\nBHAGWATI J. Two questions were referred by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal to the High Court of Bombay under section 66(1) of the Indian Income tax Act.\\n(1) Whether there is any material to justify the assessment of Rs. 30,000 (Rupees thirty thousand) from out of the sum of Rs. 61,000 (Rupees sixtyone thousand) (for Income tax and Excess Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax purposes) representing the value of high denomination notes which were encashed on the eighteenth day of January one thousand nine hundred and forty six, and (2) Whether in any event by reason of the orders of the Revenue Authorities not having found *at the alleged item was from alleged undisclosed business profits the assessment of Rs. 30,000 (Rupees thirty thousand) is in law justified for Excess Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax purposes? The High Court answered the first question in the affirmative but refused to answer the second question, being of the opinion that even though it had asked the Tribunal to refer that question under section 66 (2) of the Act, it had no jurisdiction to do so inasmuch as the appellants had not asked the Tribunal to refer 629 the second question and, therefore, no question arose of the Tribunal refusing to raise that question or to submit it for the decision of the High Court.\\nThe appellants area partnership firm doing business in Mill Stores at Ahmedabad.\\nTheir head office is in Ahmedabad and their branch office is in Bombay.\\nThe Governor General on 12th January 1946 promulgated the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1946 and High Denomination Bank Notes ceased to be legal tender on the expiry of 12th day of January 1946.\\nPursuant to clause 6 of the Ordinance the appellants on 18th January 1946 encashed high denomination notes of Rs. 1,000 each of the face value of Rs. 6 1,000.\\nThis was done in the calendar year 1946 being the account year corresponding with assessment year 1947 48.\\nDuring the assessment proceedings for the year 1947 48 the Income tax Officer called upon the appellant to prove from whom and when the said high denomination notes of Rs. 61,000 were received by the appellants and also the bona fides of the previous owners thereof.\\nAfter examining the entries in the books of account of the appellants and the position of the Cash Balances on various dates from 20th December 1945 to 18th January 1946 and the nature and extent of the receipts and payments during the relevant period, the Income tax Officer came to the conclusion that in order to sustain the contention of the appellants he would have to presume that there were 18 high denomination notes of Rs. 1,000 each in the Cash Balance on 1st January 1946 and that all cash receipts after 1st January 1946 and before 13th January 1946 were received in currency notes of Rs. 1,000 each, a presumption which he found impossible to make in the absence of any evidence.\\nHe, therefore, added the sum of Rs. 61,000 to the assessable income of the appellants from undisclosed sources.\\nOn appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the appellants produced before him affidavits of three persons to show that the appellants had received Rs. 20,000 in 1,000 rupees currency notes on 28th 630 December 1945, Rs. 15,000 in 1,000 rupees currency notes on 6th January 1946 and Rs. 8,500 in 1,000 rupees currency notes (making Rs. 8,000) on 8th January 1946, thus aggregating to Rs. 43,500 during the relevant period.\\nThe Appellate, Assistant Commissioner did not accept the statements contained in the said affidavits and dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order of the Income tax Officer.\\nAn appeal was taken by the appellants before the Income tax Appellate Tribunal.\\nThe Tribunal after taking into consideration all the materials which bad been placed before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, including the said affidavits, was of the opinion that if it was to accept the appellants ' contention, it would mean that practically every payment above Rs. 1,000 was received by the appellants in high denomination notes, which was almost impossible.\\nThe Tribunal could not say that the appellants bad no high denomination notes with them.\\nIt accepted the books of account of the appellants but thought that the cash balance on 18th January 1946 could not have sixtyone high denomination notes.\\nIt came to the conclusion that the appellants appeared to have put in high denomination notes in the cash balance and taken the other notes away.\\nIt accepted the appellants ' explanation only in regard to 31 notes and directed that the appellants ' assessment for the year under reference be reduced by that amount and dismissed the rest of the appeal.\\nThe appellants applied to the Tribunal for stating a case and referring the first question of law to the High Court for its opinion under section 66(1) of the Act.\\nThe Tribunal rejected the said application holding that no question of law arose from its order.\\nThe appellants thereupon applied to the High Court under section 66(2) of the Act for an order directing the Tribunal to state a case and refer the questions set out in the application.\\nThe High Court directed the Tribunal to state a case and refer the two questions of law set out hereinabove to it for its decision under section 66(2) of the Act.\\nIn stating the case and referring the said questions of law to the High 631 Court, the Tribunal pointed out that the second question was not urged before the Tribunal at any stage and hence it was not dealt with by it in its original order.\\nThe reference was heard by the High Court and the High Court answered the first referred question in the affirmative, but did not answer the second referred question.\\nThe High Court held that there were materials before the Tribunal to hold that the sum of Rs. 30,000 represented the income of the appellants from undisclosed sources and that the finding of the Tribunal was a finding of fact based on materials before it and even if it was an inference drawn by the Tribunal, the inference was based on the facts and materials before the Tribunal.\\nThe High Court observed that it was impossible to say that the inference drawn by the Tribunal from the circumstances was an unreasonable inference or an arbitrary and capricious inference or an inference which no judicial tribunal could ever draw.\\nIt, therefore, answered the first referred question in the affirmative.\\nAs regards the second referred question, the High Court held that question was not raised by the appellants in their application for reference under section 66(1) of the Act and, therefore, it bad no jurisdiction to ask the Tribunal to state a case on a particular question of law, where the appellants themselves had never asked the Tribunal to refer such a question to the High Court and that even though it had directed the Tribunal under section 66(2) to refer the said question, as it had no jurisdiction to ask the Tribunal to refer the said question, it was not open to it to answer the second question which had been raised by the Tribunal at its instance and refused to answer it.\\nOn a petition made by the appellants for leave to appeal to this court, the High Court granted a certificate that this was a fit case for appeal to this court and hence this appeal.\\nIt may be mentioned at the outset that the assessment of the appellants by the Income tax Officer was under section 23(3) and section 26 A of the Act.\\nThe 632 books of account of the appellants were accepted by the Income tax Officer and the only scrutiny made by the Income tax Officer was whether at the relevant date, i.e. on 12th January 1946, the appellants had in their cash 61 notes of high denomination of Rs. 1,000 each.\\nThe cash book entries from 20th December 1945 up to 18th January 1946 were put in before the Income tax Officer and they showed that on 28th December 1945 Rs. 20,000 were received from the Anand Textiles, and there was an opening balance of Rs. 18,395 on 2nd January 1946.\\nRs. 15,000 were received by the appellants on 7th January 1946 from the Sushico Textiles and Rs. 8,500 were received by them on 8th January 1946 from Manihen, widow of Shah Maneklal Nihalchand.\\nVarious other sums were also received by the appellants from 2nd January 1946 up to and inclusive of 1 1 th January 1946, which were either multiples of Rs. 1,000 or were over Rs. 1,000 and were thus capable of having been paid to the appellants in high denomination notes of Rs. 1,000.\\nThere was a cash balance of Rs. 69,891 2 6 with the appellants on 12th January 1946, when the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance 1946 was promulgated and it was the case of the appellants that they had then in their custody and possession 61 high denomination notes of Rs. 13000, which they encashed through the Eastern Bank, on 18th January 1946.\\nThe appellants further sought to support their contention by procuring before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the affidavits of Kuthpady Shyama Shetty, General Manager of Messrs Shree Anand Textiles, in regard to payment to the appellant is of a sum of Rs. 20,000 in Rs. 1,000 currency notes on 28th December 1945, Govindprasad Ramjivan Nivetia, proprietor of Messrs Shusiko Textiles, in regard to payment to the appellants of a sum of Rs. 15,000 in Rs. 1,000 currency notes on 6th January 1946 and Bai Maniben, widow of Shah Maneklal Nihalchand, in regard to payment to the appellants of a sum of Rs. 8,500 (Rs. 8,000 thereout being in Rs. 1,000 currency notes) on 8th January 1946.\\nThe appellants were not in a position to give further 633 particulars of Rs. 1,000 currency notes received by them during the relevant period, as they were not in the habit of noting these particulars in their cash book and therefore relied upon the position as it could be spelt out of the entries in their cash book coupled with these affidavits in order to show that on 12th January 1946 they had in their cash balance of Rs. 69,891 2 6, the 61 high denomination currency notes of Rs. 1,000 each, which they encashed on 18th January 1946 through the Eastern Bank.\\nBoth the Income tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner discounted this suggestion of the appellants by holding that it was impossible that the appellants had on hand on 12th January 1946, the 61 high denomination currency notes of Rs. 1,000 each, included in their cash balance of Rs. 69,891 2 6.\\nThe calculations.\\n, which they made involved taking into account all payments received by the appellants from and after 2nd January 1946, which were either multiples of Rs. 1,000 or were over Rs. 1,000.\\nThere was a cash balance of Rs. 18,395 6 6 on band on 2nd January 1946, which could have accounted for 18 such notes.\\nThe appellants received thereafter as shown in their cash book several sums of monies aggregating to over Rs. 45,000 in multiples of Rs. 1,000 or sums over Rs. 1,000, which could account for 45 other notes of that high denomination, thus making up 63 currency notes of the high denomination of Rs. 1,000 and these 61 currency notes of Rs. 1,000 each, which the appellants encashed on 18th January 1946 could as well have been in their custody on 12th January 1946.\\nThis was, however, considered impossible by both the Income tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner as they could not consider it within the bounds of possibility that each and every .payment received by the appellants after 2nd January 1946 in multiples of Rs. 1,000 or over Rs. 1,000 was received by the appellants in high denomination notes of Rs. 1,000 each. ' It was by reason of their visualisation of such an impossibility that they negatived the appellants ' contention.\\nIt has to be noted, however, that beyond there 82 634 calculations of figures, no further scrutiny was made by the Income tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of the entries in the cash book of the appellants.\\nThe cash book of the appellants was raccepted and the entries therein were not challenged.\\nNo further documents or vouchers in relation to those entries were called for, nor was the presence of the deponents of the three affidavits considered necessary by either party.\\nThe appellants took it that the affidavits of these parties were enough and neither the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, nor the Incometax Officer, who was present at the hearing of the appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, considered it necessary to call for them in order to cross examine them with reference to the statements made by them in their a affidavits.\\nUnder these circumstances it was not open to the Revenue to challenge the correctness of the cash book entries or the statements made by those deponents in their affidavits.\\nThis being the position, the state of affairs, as it ob tained on 12th January 1946, had got to be appreciated, having, regard to those entries in the cash books and the affidavits filed before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, taking them at their face value.\\nThe entries in the cash books disclosed that, taking the number of high denomination notes at 18 on 2nd January 1946, there came in the custody or possession of the appellants after 2nd January 1946 and up to 12th January 1946, 49 further notes of that high denomination, making 67 such notes in the aggregate, out of which 61 such notes could be encashed by the appellants on 18th January 1946 through the Eastern Bank.\\nA mere calculation of the nature indulged in by the Income tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was not enough, without any further scrutiny, to dislodge the position taken up by the appellants, supported as it was, by the entries in the cash book and the affidavits put in by the appellants before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.\\nThe Tribunal also fell into the same error.\\nIt could 635 not negative the possibility of the appellant being in possession of a substantial number of these high deno mination currency notes.\\nIt, however, considered that it was impossible for the appellants to have bad 61 such notes in the cash balance in their hands on 12th January 1946 and then it applied a rule of the thumb treating 31 out of such 61 notes as within the bounds of possibility, excluding 30 such notes as not covered by the explanation of the appellants.\\nThis was pure surmise and had no basis in the evidence, which was on the record of the proceedings.\\nThe High Court treated this finding of the Tribunal as a mere finding of fact.\\nThe position in regard to all such findings of fact, as to whether they can be questioned in appeal, is thus laid down by the House of Lords in Cameron vs Prendergast (Inspector of Taxes) (1): \\\"Inferences from facts stated by the Commissioners are matters of law and can be questioned on appeal.\\nThe same remark is true as to the construction of documents.\\nIf the Commissioners state the evidence and hold upon that evidence that certain results follow, it is open to the Court to differ from such a holding\\\".\\nTo the same effect are the observations of the House of Lords in Bomford vs Osborne (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) (2): \\\"No doubt there are many cases in which Commissioners, having had proved or admitted before them a series of facts, may deduce therefrom further conclusions which are themselves conclusions of pure fact.\\nBut in such cases the determination in point of law is that the facts proved or admitted provide evidence to support the Commissioners ' conclusions\\\".\\nThe latest pronouncement of the House of Lords on this question is to be found in Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) vs Bairstow and Another(3).\\nViscount Simonds observed at page 586: \\\"For it is universally conceded that, though it is (1) [1940]8I.T.R.(Suppl.)75,81.\\n(2) [1942] 10 I.T.R. (Suppl.) 27, 34.\\n(3) 636 a pure finding of fact, it may be set aside on grounds which have been stated in various ways but are, I think, fairly summarised by saying that the court should take that course if it appears that the Commissioners have acted without any evidence or upon a view of the facts which could not reasonably be entertained\\\".\\nand Lord Radcliffe expressed himself as under at page 592: \\\"If the case contains anything ex facie which is bad law and which bears upon the determination, it is, obviously erroneous in point of law.\\nBut, without any such misconception appearing ex facie, it may be that the facts found are such that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal.\\nIn those circumstances, too, the court must intervene\\\".\\nIt follows, therefore, that facts proved or admitted may provide evidence to support further conclusions to be deduced from them, which conclusions may themselves be conclusions of fact and such inferences from facts proved or admitted could be matters of law.\\nThe court would be entitled to intervene if it appears that the fact finding authority has acted without any evidence or upon a view of the facts, which could not reasonably be entertained or the facts found are such that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law would have come to the determination in question.\\nThe High Court recognised this position in effect but went wrong in applying the true principles of interference with such findings of fact to the present case.\\nThe attempt which was made by the High Court to probe into the mind of the Tribunal by trying to discard the affidavit of Govindprasad Ramjivan Nivetia in regard to the payment of Rs. 15,000 to the appellants in 15 currency notes of Rs. 1,000 each on 6th January 1946 and thus reducing the aggre gate sum of Rs. 43,500 to Rs. 28,500 and justifying the figure of Rs. 31,000 arrived at by the Tribunal was really far fetched and contrary to the terms of 637 the tribunal ' s order itself,the Tribunal not having given any inkling, whatever, of what was at the back of its mind when it fixed upon the figure Rs. 31,000.\\nReally speaking the Tribunal had not indicated upon what material it held that Rs. 30,000 should be treated as secret profit or profits from undisclosed sources and the order passed by it was bad.\\nThe appellants had furnished a reasonable explanation for the possession of the high denomination notes of the face value of Rs. 61,000 and there was no justification for having accepted it in part and discarded it in relation to a sum of Rs. 30,000.\\nThe case was analogous to the one before the Patna High Court in Chunilal Ticamchand Coal Co. Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bihar and Orissa(1) and should have been similarly decided in favour of the appellants.\\nFor the reasons indicated above, we are of the opinion that the High Court was in error in answering the first referred question in the affirmative.\\nIt ought to have answered it in the negative and held that there were no materials to justify the assessment of Rs. 30,000 from out of the sum of Rs. 61,000, for Income tax and Excess Profits Tax and Business Profit Tax purposes representing the value of the high denomination notes which were encashed on 18th January 1946.\\nIn view of the above it is not necessary for us to go into the question whether the High Court ought to have answered the second referred question also.\\nThe answer to the first referred question being in the ' negative, the very basis for Excess Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax disappears and the second referred question becomes purely academical.\\nThe result, therefore, is that the appeal is allowed and the first referred question is answered in the negative.\\nThe appellants will have their costs here as well as in the High Court.\\nVIMNKATARAMA AYYAR J.\\nI agree to the order just proposed; but I prefer to rest my decision on the (1) 638 ground that the finding of the Tribunal that high denomination notes of the value of Rs. 30,000 represented the concealed* profits of the appellant is not supported by any evidence, and is, in consequence, erroneous in point of law and liable to be set aside.\\nThe evidence on record has been exhaustively reviewed in the judgment just delivered, and there is no need to traverse the same ground again.\\nTo put the matter in anut shell, the accounts of the appellant have been accepted by the Tribunal as genuine, and it is impossible to say, having regard to the cash balance as shown therein, that the notes in question could not have been included therein.\\nThe Tribunal observes that it is unlikely that so many high denomination notes would have been held as part of the cash on hand for such a large number of days.\\nThat, no doubt, is highly suspicious; but the decision of the Tribunal must rest not on suspicion but on legal testimony.\\nFor the respondent, Mr. Joshi con.\\ntended that the cash balance shown in the books could not be accepted as true, because the appellant had ample time to rewrite the accounts, as the Ordinance was issued on 12th January 1946 and the year of account of the assessee was the Calendar year.\\nWhether the accounts are genuine or not is a pure question of fact, and a finding on a question of fact is as much binding on the Revenue as on the subject.\\n\",\n          \"Appeal No. 135 of 1952.\\nAppeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 19th March, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature at 1030 Bombay in Appeal No. 95 of 1950 arising from the Order dated the 28th August, 1950, of the said High Court exercising its Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction in Civil Miscellaneous No. 2 of 1950.\\nBishan Narain (Sri Narain Andley with him) for the appellants.\\nM. C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, and C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General for India (J. B. Dadachanji, with them) for the respondents.\\nRegistrar of Trade Marks in person.\\nMay 7.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.\\nThis is an appeal on a certificate under section 109(c), Civil Procedure Code, from the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice section C. Shah in Civil Miscellaneous No. 2 of 1950 and restoring the order of the Registrar of Trade Marks refusing to register the appellants ' trade mark.\\nThe two questions that were canvassed before us and that fall for our determination are (1) whether the judgment of Mr. Justice Shah was subject to appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court and (2) whether Mr. Justice Shah was right in interfering with the discretion exercised by the Registrar in refusing registration of the appellants ' mark.\\nThe relevant facts shortly stated are these.\\nThe appellants are a limited liability company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913, having their registered office at Chidambaram, South Arcot District, in the Province of Madras and carrying on the business of manufacturing cotton sewing thread.\\nThe respondents are also a limited liability company registered under the English Companies Act.\\nThey have their registered office at Eagley Mills, Bolton, (England) where they manufacture 'sewing thread.\\nOne of the trade marks used by them on such thread consists of the device of an Eagle with 1031 outspread wings known as \\\"Eagle Mark\\\".\\nThis mark was first advertised in the Calcutta Exchange Gazette of 5th June, 1896.\\nSince then sewing thread bearing this mark is being regularly imported into and sold in the Indian markets on an extensive scale.\\nRound about the year 1940 the appellants started selling cotton sewing thread under a mark consisting of the device of a bird with wings fully spread out perched on a cylinder of cotton sewing thread, with the words \\\" Eagle Brand \\\" and the name of the appellant company printed on the mark.\\nThe respondents objected to the mark, upon which the appellants substituted the words \\\" Vulture Brand \\\" in the place of the words \\\" Eagle Brand\\\".\\nThereafter in the year 1942 the appellants applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks, Bombay, for registration of their amended mark as a trade mark, in class 23, in respect of cotton sewing thread claiming that the mark had been in use by them since the year 1939.\\nThough on the objection of the respondents the appellants had named the Eagle in their mark a \\\" Vulture \\\" in every other respect the mark remained unchanged.\\nThe respondents to redress their grievance started a passing off action in the District Court of South Arcot against the appellants.\\nThat action failed on the ground that the evidence offered on their behalf was meagre and they failed in proving that there was any probability of purchasers exercising ordinary caution being deceived in buying the defendants ' goods under the impression that they were the plaintiff 's goods.\\nThe result was that the grievance of the respondents remained unredressed.\\nAs above stated, in 1942, the appellants made an application to the Registrar of Trade Marks at Bombay for the registration of their mark \\\"Vulture Brand \\\" under the .\\nThe respondents gave notice of their opposition to that application under section 15(2), Rule 30, of the .\\nBy his order dated 2nd September, 1949, the Registrar of Trade Marks allowed the respondents ' opposition and rejected the application 1032 made by the appellants.\\nHe came to the conclusion that the appellants ' mark so nearly resembled the mark of the respondents as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion.\\nHe further held that to describe the mark of the appellants as \\\" Vulture Brand\\\" when the device was that of an eagle was misleading and liable to cause confusion.\\nThe appellants preferred an appeal against the order of the Registrar to the High Court of Bombay as permitted by the provisions of section 76 of the .\\nMr. Justice Shah allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the Registrar and directed the Registrar to register the mark of the appellants as a trade mark.\\nFrom the judgment of Mr. Justice Shah an appeal was preferred by the respondents under clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court.\\nThe appeal was allowed and the order of the Registrar was restored with costs throughout.\\nHence this appeal.\\nIn our judgment both the questions canvassed in this appeal admit of an easy answer in spite of a number of hurdles and difficulties suggested during the arguments.\\nIt is not disputed that the decision of Mr. Justice, Shah does constitute a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent.\\nThat being so his judgment was subject to appeal under that clause, the material part of which relevant to this enquiry is: \\\" And We do further ordain that an appeal shall lie to the said High Court of Judicature at Bombay from the judgment of one Judge of the said High Court or one Judge of any Division Court, pursuant to section 108 of the Government of India Act.\\n\\\" It was said that the provisions of this clause could not be attracted to an appeal preferred to the High Court under section 76 of the and further that the clause would have no application in a case, where the judgment could not be said to have been delivered pursuant to section 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915.\\nBoth these objections in our opinion are not well founded.\\nSection 76 (1) provides: 1033 \\\"Save as otherwise expressly provided in the Act an appeal shall lie, within the period prescribed by the Central Government, from any decision of the Registrar under this Act or the rules made thereunder to the High Court having the jurisdiction.\\n\\\" The does not provide or lay down% ' any procedure for the future conduct or career of that appeal in the High Court, indeed section 77 of the Act provides that the High Court can if it likes make rules in the matter.\\nObviously after the appeal had reached the High Court it has to be determined according to the rules of practice and procedure of that Court and in accordance with the provisions of the charter under which that Court is constituted and which confers on it power in respect to the method and manner of exercising that jurisdiction.\\nThe rule is well settled that when a statute directs that an appeal shall lie to a Court already established, then that appeal must be regulated by the practice and procedure of that Court.\\nThis rule was very succinctly stated by Viscount Haldane L.C. in National Telephone Co., Ltd. vs Postmaster General in these terms: \\\"When a question is stated to be referred to an established Court without more, it, in my opinion, imports that the ordinary incidents of the procedure of that Court are to attach, and also that any general right of appeal from its decision likewise attaches.\\n\\\" The same view was expressed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in R.M.A.R.A. Adaikappa Chettiar vs Ra.\\nChandrasekhara Thevar (2), wherein it was said: \\\"Where a legal right is in dispute and the ordinary Courts of the country are seized of such dispute the Courts are governed by the ordinary rules of procedure, applicable thereto and an appeal lies if authorised by such rules, notwithstanding that the legal right claimed arises under a special statute which does not, in terms confer a right of appeal.\\\" (1) [19I3] A.C. 546.\\n134 (2) (1947) 74 I,A. 264, 1034 Again in Secretary of State for India vs Chellikani Rama Rao (1), when dealing with the case under the Madras Forest Act their Lordships observed as follows: \\\"It was contended on behalf of the appellant that all further proceedings in Courts in India or by way of appeal were incompetent, these being excluded by the terms of the statute just quoted.\\nIn their Lordships ' opinion this objection is not well founded.\\nTheir view is that when proceedings of this character reach the District Court, that Court is appealed to as one of the ordinary Courts of the country, with regard to whose procedure, orders, and decrees the ordinary rules of the Civil Procedure Code apply.\\\" Though the facts of the cases laying down the above rule were not exactly similar to the facts of the present case, the principle enunciated therein is one of general application and has an apposite application to the facts and circumstances of the present case.\\nSection 76 of the confers a right of appeal to the High Court and says nothing more about it.\\nThat being so, the High Court being seized as such of the appellate jurisdiction conferred by section 76 it has to exercise that jurisdiction in the same manner as it exercises its other appellate jurisdiction and when such jurisdiction is exercised by a single Judge, his judgment becomes subject to appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent there being nothing to the contrary in the .\\nThe objection that Mr. Justice Shah 's judgment having been delivered on an appeal under section 76 of the could not be said to have been delivered pursuant to section 108 of the Government of India Act is also without force and seems to have been based on a very narrow and limited construction of that section and on an erroneous view of its true intent and purpose.\\nSection 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915, provides : \\\" Each High Court may by its own rules provide as it thinks fit for the exercise, by one or more Judges, or by division courts constituted by two or more Judges (1) Mad.\\n617. 1035 of the High Court, of the original and appellate juris diction vested in the Court.\\n\\\" The section is an enabling enactment and confers power on the High Courts of making rules for the exercise of their jurisdiction by single Judges or by division courts.\\nThe power conferred by the section is not circumscribed in any manner whatever and the nature of the power is such that it had, to be conferred by the use of words of the widest amplitude.\\nThere could be no particular purpose or object while conferring the power in limiting it qua the jurisdiction already possessed by the High Court, when in the other provisions of the Government of India Act it was contemplated that the existing jurisdiction was subject to the legislative power of the Governor General and the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court was liable to be enlarged, modified and curtailed by the Legislature from time to time.\\nIt is thus difficult to accept the argument that the power vested in the High Court under subsection (1) of section 108 was a limited one, and could only be exercised in respect to such jurisdiction as the High Court possessed on the date when the Act of 1915 came into force.\\nThe words of the sub section \\\"vested in the court\\\" cannot be read as meaning \\\"now vested in the court\\\".\\nIt is a well known rule of construction that when a power is conferred by a statute that power may be exercised from time to time when occasion arises unless a contrary intention appears.\\nThis rule has been given statutory recognition in section 32 of the Interpretation Act.\\nThe purpose of the reference to section 108 in clause 15 of the Letters Patent was to incor porate that power in the charter of the Court itself, and not to make it moribund at that stage and make it rigid and inflexible.\\nWe are therefore of the opinion that section 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915, conferred power on the High Court which that Court could exercise from time to time with reference to its jurisdiction whether existing at the coming into force of the Government of India Act, 1915, or whether conferred on it by any subsequent legislation.\\n1036 It was argued that simultaneously with the repeal of section 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915, and of the enactment of its provisions in section 223 of the Government of India Act of 1935 and later on :in article 225 of the Constitution of India, there had not been any corresponding amendment of clause 15 of the Letters Patent and the reference to section 108 in clause 15 of the Letters Patent could not therefore be taken as relating to these provisions, and, that being so, the High Court had no power to make rules in 1940 when the was enacted under the repealed section and the decision of Mr. Justice Shah therefore could not be said to have been given pursuant to section 108.\\nThis objection also in our opinion is not well founded as it overlooks the fact that the power that was conferred on the High Court by section 108 still subsists, and it has not been affected in any manner whatever either by the Government of India Act, 1935, or by the new Constitution.\\nOn the other hand it has been kept alive and reaffirmed with great vigour by these statutes.\\nThe High Courts still enjoy the same unfettered power as they enjoyed under section 108 of the Government of India.\\nAct, 1915, of making rules and providing whether an appeal has to be heard by one Judge or more Judges or by Division Courts consisting of two or more Judges of the High Court.\\nIt is immaterial by what label or nomenclature that power is described in the different statutes or in the Letters Patent.\\nThe power is there and continues to be there and can be exercised in the same manner as it could be exercised when it was originally conferred.\\nAs a matter of history the power was not conferred for the first time by section 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915.\\nIt had already been conferred by section 13 of the Indian High Courts Act of 1861.\\nWe are further of the opinion that the High Court was right in the ' view that reference in clause 15 to section 108 should be read as a reference to the corresponding provisions of the 1935 Act and the Constitution.\\nThe canon of construction of statutes enunciated in section 38 of the 1037 Interpretation Act and reiterated with some modifications in section 8 of the General Clauses Act is one of general application where statutes or Acts have to be construed and there is no reasonable ground for holding that that rule of construction should not be applied in construing the charters of the different High Courts.\\nThese charters were granted under statutory powers and are subject to the legislative power of the Indian Legislature.\\nAssuming however, but not conceding, that strictly speaking the provisions of the Interpretation Act and the General Clauses Act do not for any reason apply, we see no justification for holding that the principles of construction enunciated in those provisions have no application for construing these charters.\\nFor the reasons given above we hold that the High Court was perfectly justified in overruling the preliminary objection and in holding that an appeal was competent from the judgment of Mr. Justice Shah under clause 15 of the Letters Patent.\\nReliance was Placed by the appellants in the High Court and before us on the decision of the High Court of Judicature of Calcutta in Indian Electric Works vs Registrar of Trade, Marks(1) wherein a contrary view was expressed.\\nAfter a full consideration of the very elaborate and exhaustive judgment delivered in that case by both the learned Judges of the Bench that heard the appeal and with great respect we think that that case was wrongly decided and the decision is based on too narrow and restricted a construction of section 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915, and that in that decision full effect has not been given to the true intent and purpose of clause 44 of the Letters Patent.\\nBoth the learned Judges there took the view that the authority given by section 108(l) of the 1915 statute to make rules for the exercise by one or more Judges of the Court 's appellate jurisdiction was limited to the jurisdiction then vested in the Court by section (1) A.I.R. 1947 Cal.\\n1O38 106 (1) of the Act and by clause 16 of the Letters Patent.\\nIt was held that such rules thus could not relate to jurisdiction conferred by an Act passed after the commencement of the 1915 statute nor to an appeal heard by the Court pursuant to such an Act, since the jurisdiction to hear such appeal having been conferred by the particular Act could not be said to have been conferred upon, or vested in, the Court by section 106(1) and by clause 16 of the Letters Patent.\\nThis argument suffers from a two fold defect.\\nIn the first place it does not take into consideration the other provisions of the Government of India Act, 1915, particularly the provision contained in sections 65 and 72.\\nBy section 65(1) of the Government of India Act, 1915, the Governor General in Legislative Council was given power to make las for all persons, for all courts, and for all places and things, within British India.\\nBy section 72 he was also given power for promulgating ordinances in cases of emergency.\\nBy the Charter Act of 1915 therefore the High Court possessed all the jurisdiction that it had at the commencement of the Act and could also exercise all such jurisdiction that would be conferred upon it from time to time by the Legislative power conferred by that Act.\\nReference to the provisions of section 9 of the Indian High Courts Act of 1861 which section 106 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1915, replaced makes this proposition quite clear.\\nIn express terms section 9 made the jurisdiction of the High Courts subject to the legislative powers of the Governor General in Legislative Council.\\nSection 106 only conferred on the High Court \\\" jurisdiction and power to make rules for regulating the practice of the court, as were vested in them by Letters Patent, and subject to the provisions of any such Letters Patent, all such jurisdiction, powers and authority as were vested in those courts at the commencement of the Act.\\n\\\" The words \\\" subject to the legislative powers of the Governor General \\\" used in section 9 of the Charter Act of 1861 were omitted from the section, because of the wide power conferred on the Governor General by section 65 of the Government of India Act, 1915.\\nThe 1039 jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts from the very inception was all the time liable to and subject to alteration by appropriate legislation.\\nIt is therefore not right to say that section 108 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1915, empowered the High Courts to make rules only concerning the jurisdiction that those courts exercised when that Act was passed; on the other hand power was also conferred on them to make rules in respect of all jurisdiction then enjoyed or with which they may be vested hereafter.\\nClause 16 of the Letters Patent on which reliance was placed by the learned Judges of the Calcutta Court is in these terms: \\\" The High Court shall be a Court of appeal from the civil Courts of Bengal and from all other Courts subject to its superintendence and shall exercise appellate jurisdiction in such cases as are subject to appeal to the said High Court by virtue of any laws or regulations now in force.\\\" This clause is also subject to the legislative power of the appropriate Legislature as provided in clause 44 of the Letters Patent.\\nThis clause is in these terms: \\\" The provisions of the Letters Patent are subject to the legislative powers of the Governor General in Legislative Council.\\n\\\" That being so the last words of the clause \\\" now in force \\\" on which emphasis was placed in the Calcutta judgment lose all their importance, and do not materially affect the point.\\nThe true intent and purpose of clause 44 of the Letters Patent was to supplement the provisions of clause 16 and other clauses of the Letters Patent.\\nBy force of this clause appellate jurisdiction conferred by fresh legislation on the High Courts stands included within the appellate jurisdiction of the court conferred by the Letters Patent.\\nA reference to clause 15 of the Letters Patent of 1861, which clause 16 replaced, fully supports this view.\\nThis clause included a provision to the following effect : \\\" or shall become subject to appeal to the said High Court by virtue of such laws and regulations 1040 relating to Civil Procedure as shall be hereafter made, by the Governor in Council,\\\" in addition to the words \\\" laws or regulations now in force\\\".\\nThe words above cited wore omitted from clause 16 of the later charter and only the words \\\"laws or regulations now in force\\\" were retained, because these words were incorporated in the Letters Patent and were made of general application as governing all the provisions thereof by a separate clause.\\nThe Judges who gave the Calcutta decision on the other hand inferred from this change that the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court as specified in clause 16 was confined only to the jurisdiction to hear appeals from the the civil Courts mentioned in that clause and appeals under Acts passed and regulations in force up to the year 1865.\\nIn our opinion the learned Judges were in error in thinking that the appellate jurisdiction possessed by the High Court under the Letters Patent of 1865 was narrower than the jurisdiction it possessed under clause 15 of the Letters Patent of 1861.\\nWhatever jurisdiction had been conferred on the High Court by clause 15 of the Letters Patent of 1861 was incorporated in the Letters Patent of 1865 (as amended) and in the same measure and to the same extent by the provisions of clauses 16 and 44 of that charter.\\nWe are further of the opinion that the Calcutta decision is also erroneous when it expresses the view that the range and ambit of the power conferred on the High Court by section 108 of the Government of India Act of 1915 was limited by the provision of section 106 (1) of the Act or by the provisions of clause 16 of the Letters Patent.\\nThere is no justification for placing such a construction on the plain and unambiguous words of that section.\\nSection 108 is an enactment by itself and is unrestricted in its scope, and covers a much wider field than is covered by section 106 of the Government of India Act.\\nThe only association it has with section 106 is that in sequence it follows that sec tion.\\nIt confers a power on the High Court to make rules in respect not only of the jurisdiction that it 1041 enjoyed in 1915 but it also conferred power on it to make rules in respect of jurisdiction which may hereafter be conferred on it by the enactments enacted by the Governor General in Legislative Council.\\nOn the line of thought adopted in the Calcutta decision the learned Judges were forced to the conclusion which seems somewhat strange that the jurisdiction conferred by the Letters Patent on the Calcutta High Court is much more limited and restricted than has been conferred on some of the new High Courts in India by their Letters Patent.\\nIllustratively, Clause I I of the Letters Patent of Patna High Court issued in 1916 provides as follows: \\\" And We do further ordain that, the High Court of Judicature at Patna shall be a Court of Appeal from the Civil Courts of the Province of Bihar and Orissa and from all other Courts subject to its superintendence, and shall exercise appellate jurisdiction in such cases as were, immediately before the date of the publication of these presents, subject to appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal by virtue of any law then in force, or as may after that date be declared subject to appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Patna by any law made by competent legislative authority for India The Letters Patent of the Labore High Court, the High Court of Rangoon and the Letters Patent of the Nagpur High Court also contain identical clauses.\\nIt is clear from these clauses that in respect of cases subject to appeal to these High Courts the civil appellate jurisdiction is flexible and elastic.\\nMr. Justice Das in the Calcutta decision under discussion took the view that omission of the words underlined in clause 11 from clause 16 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court made the civil appellate jurisdiction of that court under clause 16 as rigidly fixed, and that it could be exercised only over courts and only in respect of cases mentioned therein.\\nWhen the attention of the learned Judge was.\\ndrawn to the provisions of clause.\\n44 of the Letters Patent he 1042 was constrained to say that inflexibility bad to a great extent been modified by preserving the powers of Indian Legislative authority in section 9 of the High Courts Act, by the amended clause 44 of the Letters Patent and by section 223 of the.\\n1935 Act.\\nThe learned Judge however felt that there was still a difference of a vital character between the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court and of the newly constituted High Courts inasmuch as cases subsequ ently declared by any Indian enactment to be subject to appeal to the Calcutta High Court could not strictly speaking come within its appellate jurisdiction under clause 16 although the High Court exercised appellate jurisdiction over these.\\nWe have not been able to appreciate this distinction and it seems to us it is based on some misapprehension as to the true intendment of clause 44 of the Letters Patent.\\nThe purpose and intent of clause 44 of the Letters Patent was to declare that in addition to the jurisdiction conferred by clause 16 it would also exercise the appellate jurisdiction which from time to time would be conferred on it by subsequent enactments.\\nIt is inconceivable that larger appellate jurisdiction and greater powers in the matter of making rules would have been conferred upon the newly constituted High Courts than upon the High Court of Calcutta.\\nThe words \\\"pursuant to section 108 of the Government of India Act 1915\\\" occurring in clause 15 of the Letters Patent do not in any way restrict the scope of the right of appeal conferred by that clause to appeals that come to the High Court under its appellate jurisdiction under clause 16 of the Letters Patent only.\\nOn the other hand we think that these rules have application to all appellate jurisdiction exercised by that court whether existing or conferred upon it by subsequent legislation.\\nThe learned Judges in the Calcutta case negatived the applicability of the principle enunciated in 1913 Appeal Cases 546 and applied by the Privy Council in several cases to the matter before them, on the following reasoning set out by Mr. Justice Das: 1043 \\\"The incidents and powers attached to the Registrar as a tribunal fall far short of those which were attached, to the tribunal in the Gurdwara case (1) and to which Sir George Rankin particularly and pointedly referred Having regard to the plain language of clause 16, and in the absence therein of like words which appeal in the concluding portions of the correspond clauses of the Letters Patent of the other High Court to which I have already referred and which make their appellate jurisdiction flexible and elastic it is impossible to hold that section 76 of the has merely extended the appellate jurisdiction of this Court under clause 16 by the addition of a new subject matter of appeal so as to attract the general principle enunciated in 1913 Appeal Cases 546 . .\\nThe truth is that the has created new rights, e.g., a right to get a trade mark registered and has given certain new advantages con sequent upon such registration.\\nIt has created new Tribunals for its own purposes and it has conferred a new appellate jurisdiction on this Court.\\nIt has authorized this Court to make rules regulating the conduct and procedure of the proceedings under the Act before it.\\nThis Court has framed separate set of rules accordingly.\\nThis very fact makes it impossible to attract the ordinary rules of procedure regarding appeals in this Court and indicates that an appeal under section 76 of the Act involves the exercise of a new appellate jurisdiction regulated by new rules\\\".\\nThis reasoning in our opinion is faulty on a number of grounds.\\nThe first error lies in the assumption that the Gurdwara Act did not create new rights and did not create new appellate jurisdiction in the High Court which it did not possess before.\\nThe Gurdwara Act created peculiar rights in religious bodies and negatived the civil rights of large bodies of Mahants and other persons.\\nStick rights were unknown before in civil law.\\nThe High Court as an established court of record was constituted a court of appeal from the decisions of the Gurdwara Tribunal.\\nThe principle enunciated in 1913 Appeal Cases 546 was applied by (1) 63 I.A. 180.\\n1044 Sir George Rankin to appeals heard by the High Court under its newly created appellate jurisdiction, and we speak with great respect, in our opinion, very correctly.\\nWe have not been able to appreciate the special peculiarities of the rights created by the which place the appellate jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by section 76 on a different level from the jurisdiction created by the special provisions of the Gurdwara Act.\\nThe rights created by the are civil rights for the protection of persons carrying on trade under marks which have acquired reputation.\\nThe statute creates the Registrar a tribunal for safeguarding these rights and for giving effect to the rights created by the Act, and the High Court as such without more has been given appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of this tribunal.\\nIt is not easy to understand on what grounds it can be said that the High Court while exercising this appellate jurisdiction has to exercise it in a manner different from its other appellate jurisdiction.\\nIt seems to us that this is merely an addition of a new subject matter of appeal to the appellate jurisdiction already exercised by the High Court.\\nThe second error lies in the assumption that the appellate jurisdiction exercised by the High Court of Calcutta is much more limited than that possessed by the other High Courts.\\nThe matter has been discussed at length in an earlier part of this judgment.\\nWe have also not been able to appreciate the emphasis laid to negative the applicability of clause 15 of the Letters Patent by reference to the provisions of section 77 of the Act.\\nThe provisions of that section are merely enabling provisions and, as already pointed out, it is open to the High Court to make use of them or not as it likes.\\nThere is nothing in the provisions of that section which debars the High Court from hearing appeals under section 76 of the according to the rules under which all other appeals are heard, or from framing rules for the exercise of that jurisdiction under section 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915, for hearing those 1045 appeals by single judges or by division benches.\\nEven if section 77 had not been enacted it could not be said that the High Court would then have no power to make rules for the hearing of appeals under section 76.\\nThere are a number of legislative enactments which have conferred appellate jurisdiction on the High Court without more and the High Court exercises appellate jurisdiction conferred by these enactments by framing its own rules under the powers it already possesses under its different charters and under the various statutes which have conferred power on it.\\nIt was suggested that the reasoning of the High Court is supported by the rule laid down in Secretary of State vs Mask and Co.(1).\\nIn our opinion that rule has neither any relevancy in this case nor is it in any manner in conflict with the rule laid down in 1913 Appeal Cases 546 or in the later Privy Council decisions above referred to.\\nThere, by section 188 of the Sea Customs Act the jurisdiction of the civil courts was excluded, and an order made by the Collector on an appeal from an order of the Assistant Collector was made final.\\nA suit was filed to challenge the order of the Collector on the ground that the finality declared by section 188 was no bar to such a suit in a civil court.\\nThat contention was negatived on the ground that when a liability not existing in common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it, with respect to that class it has always been held that the party must adopt the form of remedy given by the statute.\\nThe has not created any special forum for the hearing of an appeal as had been created by the Sea Customs Act.\\nOn the other hand, the has conferred appellate jurisdiction on an established court of law.\\nFurther, the Sea Customs Act had made the order of the Collector passed on an appeal final.\\nThere is no such provision in the .\\nIt has only declared that an appeal shall lie to the High Court from the order of the Registrar and has said nothing more about it.\\nClearly, therefore, to this case the rule (1) 67 I.A. 222. 1046 enunciated in 1913 Appeal Cases 546 had application, and the rule stated in Mask 's case (1) had no bearing on this point.\\nAs regards the merits of the case, we are in entire agreement with the decision of the High Court and with the reasons given in that decision.\\nThe relevant part of section 8 of the is in these terms: \\\"No trade mark nor part of a trade mark shall be registered which consists of, or contains, any scandalous design, or any matter the use of which would by reason of its being likely to deceive or to cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protection in a court of justice\\\".\\nUnder this section an application made to register a trade mark which is likely to deceive or to cause confusion has to be refused notwithstanding the fact that the mark might have no identity or close resemblance with any other trade mark.\\nThe Registrar has to come to a conclusion on this point independently of making any comparison of the mark with any other registered trade mark.\\nWhat the Registrar has to see is whether looking at the circumstances of the case a particular trade mark is likely to deceive or to cause confusion.\\nThe principles of law applicable to such cases are well settled.\\nThe burden of proving that the trade mark which a person seeks to register is not likely to deceive or to cause confusion is upon the applicant.\\nIt is for him to satisfy the Registrar that his trade mark does not fall within the prohibition of section 8 and therefore it should be registered.\\nMoreover, in deciding whether a particular trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion that duty is not discharged by arriving at the result by merely comparing it with the trade mark which is already registered and whose proprietor is offering opposition to the registration of the mark.\\nThe real question to decide in such cases is to see as to how a purchaser, who must be looked upon as an average man of ordinary intelligence, would react to a (1) 67 I.A. 222.\\n1047 particular trade mark, what association he would form by looking at the trade mark, and in what respect he would connect the trademark with the goods which* he would be purchasing.\\nSo far as the present case is concerned the goods sold under the respondents ' trade mark are well known and are commonly asked for as II Eagley \\\" or \\\" Eagle \\\", and the particular feature of the trade mark of the respondents by which the goods are identified and which is associated in the mind of the purchaser is the representation of an Eagle appearing in the trade mark.\\nIf the trade mark conveys the idea of an Eagle and if an unwary purchaser is likely to accept the goods of the appellants as answering the requisition for Eagle goods, then undoubtedly the appellants ' trade mark is one which would be likely to deceive or cause confusion.\\nIt is clear to us that the bird in the appellants ' trade mark is likely to be mistaken by an average man of ordinary intelligence as an Eagle and if he asked for Egg`e goods and he got goods bearing this trade mark of the appellants it is not likely that he would reject them by saying that this cannot be an Eagle.\\nTwo years prior to the application for registration, the respondents described this particular bird an Eagle and called their brand Eagle Brand, The same bird was later on described by them a vulture and the explanation offered was that they so described owing to an honest and bona fide mistake.\\nWe have no hesitation in holding that the appellants ' camouflaging an Eagle into a vulture by calling it such is likely to cause confusion.\\nWhatever else may be said about the bird in the appellants ' trade mark, it certainly does not represent a vulture or look like a vulture of any form or shape.\\nWhat has been named by the plaintiffs as a vulture is really an eagle seated in a different posture.\\nThat being so, the High Court was perfectly right in the view that Mr. Justice Shah was in error in interfering with the discretion possessed and exercised by the Registrar, and that the appellants had failed to discharge the onus that rested heavily on them to prove that the trade mark which they wanted the Registrar 1048 to register was not likely to deceive or cause confusion.\\nThe learned counsel for the appellants contended that the question whether his clients ' trade mark was likely to deceive or cause confusion had been 'Concluded by the earlier judgment of the Madras High Court in the passing off action and already referred to in an early part of the judgment.\\nIt is quite clear that the onus in a passing off action rests on the plaintiff to prove whether there is likelihood of the defendant 's goods being passed off as the goods of the plaintiff.\\nIt was not denied that the general get up of the appellants ' trade mark is different from the general get up of the respondents ' trade mark.\\nThat being so, it was held by the Madras High Court in the passing off action that on the meager material placed on record by the plaintiffs they had failed to prove that the defendants ' goods could be passed off as the goods of the plaintiffs.\\nThe considerations relevant in a passing off action are somewhat different than they are on an application made for registration of a mark under the and that being so the decision of the Madras High Court referred to above could not be considered as relevant on the questions that the Registrar had to decide under the provisions of the Act.\\nFor the reasons given above we are of the opinion that this appeal must fail and we accordingly dismiss it with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\",\n          \"IMINAL Appeal No. 95 of 1957.\\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 16, 1955, of the Allahabad

N. Rishbud and Inder Singh vs The State of Delhi (1) does not support the submission made by Mr. Umrigar on behalf of the appellant.\\nHe, however, referred to a passage in the aforesaid cited decision at page 1164 to the effect that where a breach of a mandatory provision is brought to the knowledge of the court at a sufficiently early stage, the court, while not declining cognizance, would have to take the necessary steps to get the illegality cured and the defect rectified by ordering such investigation as the circumstances of the case may call for.\\nIt has not been shown to ' our satisfaction that the attention of the trial court was drawn at an early stage to any breach of the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\\nThere had been an enquiry before commitment to the

objection had been taken at a sufficiently early stage and that in view of the decision of this Court in the case cited the trial court ought not have proceeded with the trial unless the defect had been removed.\\nThe decision of this Court in the case cited is clear, however, that generally a conviction is not vitiated because there had not been strict compliance with the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act in the matter of investigation by a police officer.\\nAs to whether the objection was taken at a sufficiently early stage is a question of fact and ought to have been raised in the High Court as the decision of this Court in the case cited had been delivered something like a year before.\\nAs this point in this form was not raised before the High Court we cannot allow it to be raised at this stage.\\nIt was next contended that the Assistant Sessions Judge who tried the case had no jurisdiction to try the case as it was triable by a Special Judge only.\\nIt is clear, however, that the case had been committed to the Court of Session before the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952, came into force.\\nUnder section 10 of this Act all cases pending before the Court of a Magistrate were transferred to the Court of a Special Judge.\\nSection 10 did not purport to transfer cases, pending in the Court of Session at the commencement of the Act, to the Court of the Special Judge.\\nIn the case of Asgarali Nazarali Singaporewalla vs The .State(1), this Court observed \\\"The cases which were pending before the courts of sessions did not require to be so transferred because they would be tried by the procedure obtaining in the courts of sessions and nothing further required to be done.\\\" It seems clear to us, therefore, that the Assistant Sessions Judge had jurisdiction to try the case as the same had been (1)[1957] S.C.R. 678, 686. 780 pending in the court of Session when the Act came into force.\\nThe third contention raised was that the courts below had not correctly appreciated the nature, extent and the quantum of proof required for raising the presumption under section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\\nThe High Court 's judgment does not show that that Court in any way raised any presumption under section 4 against the appellant.\\nThe following passage from the High Court 's judgment would make this clear: \\\" It was next contended that the evidence on the record does not satisfactorily prove that the sum of Rs.20 was received by the applicant as illegal gratification.\\nThe finding on this point is a finding of fact.\\nI have gone through the judgment of both the courts below and I see no satisfactory reason to disagree with the concurrent finding of both the courts on this point.\\nThere is ample evidence on behalf of the prosecution to the conclusion that the sum of Rs. 20 was paid by Malekchand to the applicant on his demand in order to secure the allotment of a house.\\nThere does not appear any satisfactory reason why Malekchand should have paid Rs. 20 to the applicant to procure wheat for him.\\n\\\" There is, therefore, no question of any presumption being raised against the appellant.\\nOn the contrary, his defence that he had taken the sum of Rs. 20 from Malekchand to purchase wheat for him was disbelieved and Malekchand 's evidence that he had taken this money in order to secure an allotment of a house for Malekchand was accepted.\\nThere appears to be no substance in the point raised.\\nIt was next urged that the matter of sentence may be considered.\\nThe incident took place in 1951 and the appellant has been on bail and it would not be desirable to send him back to jail.\\nThe sentence of one year 's imprisonment for corruption by a public servant cannot, however, be considered as unduly severe.\\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

        "Whereas the Government of Bombay is satisfied with respect to the person known as Shri Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza of Bombay, that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the relations of India with the Portuguese Government and to the Security of India, it is necessary to make the following Order: Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub clause (1) of clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 3 of the (Act IV of 1950) the Government of Bombay is pleased to direct that Shri Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza of Bombay, be detained.\n",

        "The validity of the order is challenged on the following contentions.\n",
        "1.The order of detention was mala fide.\n",
        "It was passed for the ulterior purpose of preventing his freedom of speech and freedom of professional activity in the sphere of Goan affairs by reason of his known views in this behalf.\n",
        "2.The detaining authority,in exercising its power, failed to apply its mind to the existence or otherwise of the legitimate objects of detention.\n",
        "The grounds of detention are vague.\n",
        "385 4.The claim of State that no particulars of the grounds could be furnished in public interest is unsustainable and in any case mala fide.\n",
        "The last two have been urged before us not only as independent points but as reinforcing the first two.\n",
        "The challenge to the validity of the order based on the attack of mala fides and non application of the, mind of the detaining authority, have been urged before us with great insistence.\n",
        "We have been taken elaborately into what is claimed to be the relevant previous background of events.\n",
        "This part of the argument raises, what ultimately are questions of fact which have been fully considered by the High Court.\n",
        "It is, therefore, enough to state, in its broad outlines, the background, which is alleged as follows: (1)(a) There was a sudden search by the police on the 24th August, 1954, at the appellant 's place for alleged possession of illicit liquor.which, in fact, was not found.\n",
        "But under the guise thereof the police seized and carried away a mass of documents, papers and printed material of the appellant as also a typewriter belonging to him.\n",
        "(b)On the same day, a search was carried out by the police also at his residence at Mahim but nothing was found.\n",
        "(c)Immediately following the searches, the appellant was taken into illegal police custody and interrogated, and physically assaulted, and threatened.\n",
        "The above high handed action of the police, by way of search and seizure, was the subject matter of challenge by the appellant by means of a writ application in the High Court in which the police officers concerned filed affidavits virtually admitting the appellant 's allegations relating to seizure of papers, etc.\n",
        "The State itself could not support the said highhandedness.\n",
        "As a result, the High Court directed on the 3rd November, 1954, the return forthwith of all the papers and articles seized.\n",
        "Notwithstanding that order, the materials so illegally seized were returned only on or about the 21st January, 1955.\n",
        "(2) When one Joaquim Carlos, a Portuguese soldier 386 attached to Goan forces, was arrested on a charge of entering Indian territory without the requisite authority, the appellant rendered professional assistance to him and obtained an order of release on bail from the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, which was foiled by the police by removing him away to Sawantwadi before the requisite sureties could be obtained at Bombay.\n",
        "The trial was hurried through and the said Carlos was convicted.\n",
        "But on appeal, filed by the appellant, before the Sessions Judge, the conviction was set aside and retrial ordered.\n",
        "These events happened between February to April, 1955.\n",
        "(3)Between April, 1955 to June, 1955, there occurred certain incidents which were inspired and instigated by the members of the Goan Action Committee who were agitating against Portuguese hold over Goa.\n",
        "There was a raid on certain pro Portuguese presses by some private persons, in the course of which heavy damage was caused.\n",
        "There was also an assault on himself (appellant) by a gang of persons of whom some were employees of the Goan Action Committee.\n",
        "In respect of these two incidents private complaints had been filed by or on behalf of the affected persons.\n",
        "The attitude and behaviour of the police in respect of these complaints were clearly indicative of their being in league with the Goan Action Committee.\n",
        "The appellant 's counsel strongly urged that the bona fides of the detaining authority is to be judged with reference to the above background of events and that viewed in that light the vagueness of the grounds and the belated claim of privilege under article 22(6) of the Constitution strengthen his contention.\n",
        "He also relied on what are urged as being certain discrepancies in the affidavits of the Under Secretary and the Chief Secretary filed in the High Court in these proceedings.\n",
        "It is strongly urged that the order of detention was made without any real application of mind by the detaining authority, that the authority acted merely at the instance of the police who were in league with the Goan Action Committee, and that the police procured the detention 387 order for the purpose of suppressing the freedom of the appellant, to ventilate his point of view on the Goan politics and to take up professionally the cause of persons in the position of Carlos.\n",
        "We have been taken through all the material relating to the above allegations and have given our consideration to the same.\n",
        "It is enough to say that we are unable to see any reason for disagreeing with the conclusion of the High Court to the effect that the material is not enough to make out that the detaining authority was acting otherwise than bona fide.\n",
        "We also agree with the view of the High Court that, what has got to be made out is not the want of bona fides on the part of the police, but want of bona fides, as well as the non application of mind, on the part of the detaining authority, viz. the Government, which for this purpose must be taken to be different from the police.\n",
        "It is also clear that the allegation of non application of mind by the detaining authority is without any basis, in view of the affidavit of the Chief Secretary.\n",
        "The further points that remain for consideration are those which relate to the complaint of vagueness of the grounds furnished and the alleged unsustainable claim for non disclosure under article 22(6) of the Constitution on behalf of the detaining authority, to get over the alleged vagueness.\n",
        "To appreciate the points thus raised, it is necessary to have an idea of the grounds of detention as furnished.\n",
        "They are to be found from the relevant communication to the detenue which is as follows: \"In pursuance of section 7 of the (Act IV of 1950) you are hereby informed that the grounds on which a detention order has been made against you, by the Government of Bombay under sub clause (1) of clause (a) of subsection (1) of section 3 of the said Act are that: With the financial help given by the Portuguese authorities you are carrying on espionage on behalf of the Portuguese Government with the help of underground workers.\n",
        "You are also collecting intelligence about the security arrangements on the border area and you make such intelligence available to the Portu 388 guese authorities.\n",
        "These activities which are being carried on by you with the object of causing further deterioration in the relations between the Portuguese Government and the Indian Government over the question of Goan National Movement, are prejudicial to the security of India and to the relations of India with Portugal.\n",
        "2.If you wish to make a representation against the order under which you are detained, you should address it to the Government of Bombay and forward it through the Superintendent, Arthur Road Prison, Bombay.\n",
        "3.You are also informed that you have a right to claim a personal hearing before the Advisory Board and that you should communicate to Government of Bombay as soon as possible your intention of exercising or not exercising that right\".\n",
        "The objection by the appellant relating to this is contained in paragraph 15(g) of his application before the High Court.\n",
        "It is as follows: \"The grounds are not specific and no particulars of the activities alleged to have been carried on by the petitioner are given, viz. the particulars such as the length of period for which the petitioner is alleged to have carried on the so called espionage activities or the details of financial aid alleged to have been received by the petitioner from the Portuguese authorities or the names of any of the so called underground workers alleged to be aiding the petitioner or any details of intelligence alleged to have been collected by the petitioner or made available by him to the Portuguese Government\".\n",
        "The answer thereto of the Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay is in paragraph 12 of his affidavit dated the 25th July, 1955, and is as follows: \"With reference to paragraph 15, clause (g), I submit that it is not necessary to mention particulars of the espionage activities carried on by the petitioner or the details of the financial aid received by him or the names of the persons aiding the said petitioner.\n",
        "It is not in public interest to disclose these details; nor is it necessary to mention these matters to afford 389 the petitioner reasonable opportunity to make a representation\" Now the question as to whether the grounds furnished are vague or not, is ultimately a question that has to be determined on a consideration of the circumstances of each case, as was pointed out by this court in the State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya(1) in the following passage: \"The contention that the grounds are vague requires some clarification. . . .\n",
        "If the ground which is supplied is incapable of being understood or defined with sufficient certainty it can be called vague.\n",
        "It is not possible to state affirmatively more on the question of what is vague.\n",
        "It must vary according to the circumstances of each case. . . .\n",
        "If on reading the ground furnished it is capable of being intelligently understood and is sufficiently definite to furnish materials to enable the detained person to make a representation against the order of detention it cannot be called vague\".\n",
        "In the present case, the detenue has been intimated why, in the opinion of the Government the activities of the appellant are considered prejudicial to the security of India and to the relations of India with Portugal.\n",
        "They are the following: 1.With the financial help given by the Portuguese authorities, he is carrying on espionage on behalf of the Portuguese Government with the help of underground workers.\n",
        "2.He is collecting intelligence about the security arrangements on the border area and making such intelligence available to the Portuguese authorities.\n",
        "3.He is carrying on these activities with the object of causing further deterioration in the relations between the Portuguese Government and the Indian Government over the question of the Goan National Movement.\n",
        "It is true that these allegations are not as precise and specific as might have been desired.\n",
        "But having regard to the nature of the alleged activities of the appellant, it is not unlikely that no more could be gathered or furnished.\n",
        "In this context it is relevant (1) ; ,184.\n",
        "51 390 to notice that the appellant himself does not appear to have felt that the grounds furnished were so vague as to hamper him in his right to make a representation under article 22(5) and section 7 of the Act.\n",
        "It does not appear that he applied to the Government to be supplied with particulars of the grounds furnished to him.\n",
        "Such a right to call for particulars has been recognised in the case in the State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya(1) as flowing from his constitutional right to be afforded a reasonable opportunity to make a representation to the Board.\n",
        "In that case it has been stated that \"if the grounds are not sufficient to enable the detenue to make a representation, the detenue. . if he likes, may ask for particulars which would enable him to make the representation\".\n",
        "The fact that be bad made no such application for particulars is, therefore, a circumstance which may well be taken into consideration, in deciding whether the grounds can be considered to be vague.\n",
        "In the circumstances and having regard to thefact that what is alleged is espionage activity ata time when relations between the two Governments on the affairs of Goa were somewhat delicate, we are inclined to think, with the High Court, that the grounds cannot be considered to be vague.\n",
        "Assuming however that the grounds furnished in this case are open to the challenge of vagueness, the further question which arises is whether the validity of the order of detention can be sustained by reason of the claim, in public interest, of non disclosure of facts made by the Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay by means of his affidavit filed in the High Court.\n",
        "Now it has been held in Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya 's case(1) by the majority of the Court, that the constitutional right of a detenue under article 22(5) comprises two distinct components.\n",
        "1.The right to be furnished grounds of detention as soon as may be; and 2.The right to be afforded the earliest opportunity of making a representation against his detention (1) ; ,184. 391 which implies, the right to be furnished adequate particulars of the grounds of detention, to enable a proper representation being made.\n",
        "These rights involve corresponding obligations on the part of the detaining authority.\n",
        "It follows that the authority is under a constitutional obligation to furnish reasonably definite grounds, as well as adequate particulars then and there, or shortly thereafter.\n",
        "But the right of the detenue to be furnished particulars, is subject to the limitation under article 22(6) whereby disclosure of facts considered to be against public interest cannot be required.\n",
        "It is however to be observed that under article 22(6) the facts which cannot be required to be disclosed are those \"which such authority considers to be against public interest to disclose\".\n",
        "Hence it follows that both the obligation to furnish particulars and the duty to consider whether the disclosure of any facts involved therein is against public interest, are vested in the detaining authority, not in any other.\n",
        "It was accordingly attempted to be argued in the High Court that the claim of non disclosure made in the affidavit of the Under Secretary indicated a decision for nondisclosure, by the Under Secretary himself and that too at the time of filing the affidavit.\n",
        "On this assumption it was contended that the claim for non disclosure was invalid.\n",
        "The High Court, however, on a consideration of the material, felt satisfied that what was stated in the affidavit related to the decision of the detaining authority itself, taken at the time.\n",
        "The learned Judges expressed their conclusion as follows: \"There is nothing in the affidavit of Mr. Bambawala to suggest that it is now that the detaining authority is claiming privilege or applying its mind to the question of privilege. . . . .\n",
        "The meaning is clear that at no time it was in public interest to disclose the details referred to in the particular paragraph of the affidavit and there is nothing to suggest that this question was not considered by the detaining authority at the time when the grounds were furnished\".\n",
        "No argument has been addressed to us how this con 392 elusion is incorrect.\n",
        "But what has been urged before us is that the decision not to disclose the facts as well as the ambit of the non disclosure must be clearly communicated to the detenue at the time when the grounds are furnished.\n",
        "It is urged that if the detenue is furnished information, at least to that extent, it will enable him to present to the Advisory Board his difficulties in making a proper representation and to convey to it a request for obtaining the requisite particulars from the State under section 10 of the Act for their own information and consideration.\n",
        "We are unable to imply any such obligation under article 22(5) and (6).\n",
        "The necessity for such a communication would arise only if the detenue, feeling the grounds to be vague, asks for particulars.\n",
        "An obligation to communicate the decision not to disclose facts considered prejudicial to public interest may well be implied in such a situation.\n",
        "But in the absence of any such request by the detenue, the non communication of the decision cannot be held to have hampered his constitutional right of representation and an obligation to communicate cannot be implied in these circumstances.\n",
        "In the present case there is no merit in this contention.\n",
        "If the appellant bad exercised his right to ask for particulars, at the time, from the detaining authority, there can be no doubt that he would have been furnished then the very information which has been supplied in paragraph 12 of the Under Secretary 's affidavit in answer to para 15(g) of the appellant 's petition, both of which have been already set out above.\n",
        "A faint suggestion has been made in the course of the arguments before us that the decision not to disclose particulars is mala fide and that such mala fides has to be imputed in a case where no particulars are at all furnished.\n",
        "It is suggested that the power not to disclose facts considered against public interest cannot be so exercised as to nullify the constitutional right of the detenue for being afforded a proper opportunity of representation.\n",
        "Such a contention as to the mala fide exercise of the power is untenable in the present case having regard to the nature of the 393 grounds on which the detention is based and the nature of activities imputed therein to the appellant.\n",
        "It is unnecessary, therefore, to deal in this case with a theoretical contention as to whether or not article 22(6) of the Constitution overrides the constitutional right to be furnished particulars under article 22(5) to the extent of denying all particulars and leaving the grounds absolutely vague.\n",
        "All the contentions raised before us fail and this appeal is dismissed. \"\"\"\n",
